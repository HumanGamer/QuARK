First, note that you need no special software to browse the <link svn>on-line version of the repository</link>.

To checkout and commit files to the repository, download and install TortoiseSVN from <a target="_blank" href="http://tortoisesvn.net/">tortoisesvn.net</a>. That website also contains quite complete Help Documentation about how to install and get you started using TortoiseSVN. The checkout URL to use is given on the SourceForge repository page; its the text field labeled with "svn checkout".

Another useful program is <b>WinMerge</b>. This program allows you to compare two directories, complete with files and subdirectories, to look for changes. You can download it from the <a target="_blank" href="http://winmerge.org/">winmerge.org</a> site. It comes in handy when you want to maintain a local copy of the CVS to work in.
