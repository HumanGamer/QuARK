title: Anonymous downloading
author: Armin Rigo

Once WinCVS is installed, you can anonymously download the QuArK source. Configure WinCVS (from the Admin menu) as follows:

<code>
CVS Root:              anonymous@cvs.quark.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/quark
Authentication method: pserver (password-based)
</code>

You can then checkout one or several of the modules "source", "runtime" and "infobase". If you are prompted for a password,
type enter (no password).

"Checkout" means the initial download; "Update" means smaller downloads that only carry the updates that other people have
done; "Commit" means upload of your own changes.

Be careful, it seems that if you checkout modules anonymously, you might not be able to commit changes later even if you
officially register. To prevent problems, avoid modifying files that you downloaded anonymously. If you want to modify these
files, first officially register and checkout the modules under your official name.
