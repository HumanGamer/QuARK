Here's a small list of some of the terms used in Eclipse and this description about Eclipse:

<b>Check out a file/directory</b> - Downloading a file/directory from the CVS into your Workspace-directory.

<b>Committing a file/directory</b> - Uploading a file/directory from your Workspace-directory to the CVS.

<b>Conflict</b> - When there are changes made to the remote file, and conflicting changes in the local file.

<b>CVS</b> - Concurrent Versions System. The system used to store the online files on SourceForge.

<b>Local file</b> - A file in your Workspace-directory.

<b>Perspective</b> - The current 'view' you're working in. Every perspective has its own functions, allowing you to do different things with the files.

<b>Remote file</b> - A file located in the repository, on the CVS.

<b>Repository</b> - The online site where the files are actually kept.

<b>Workspace</b> - The directory in which Eclipse stores the local files.
