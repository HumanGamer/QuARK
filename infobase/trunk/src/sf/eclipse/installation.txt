title: Installation

First, you will need to download and install the <b>Java Runtime Environment (JRE)</b> (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.java.com/">http://www.java.com/</a>) (currently Version 6 Update 20), since Eclipse needs this.  The JRE basically installs itself, so no configuration instructions are really needed here.

Then download and install <b>Eclipse</b> (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/">http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/</a>).  You only need one file, the "Eclipse Classic" one. (Currently version 3.6.0, with the filename of eclipse-SDK-3.6-win32.zip (for Windows 32 bit)).  It is a zip file so you might need a utility like WinZip to unpack it (note: keep the directory structure!).  The default and generally recommended directory to extract it to is c:\eclipse. For the rest of this article, we'll assume that's the Eclipse install directory.
