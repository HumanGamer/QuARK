First, you will need to download and install <b>Java 2 Platform</b> (<a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/download.html">http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/download.html</a>). You will only need the <b>Runtime Environment</b> version rather than the full <b>SDK</b> version. This program basically installs itself , so no configuration instructions are really needed here.

Then download and install <b>Eclipse</b> (<a href="http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/index.php">http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/index.php</a>).
