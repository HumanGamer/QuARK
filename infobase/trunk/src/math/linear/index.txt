title: Linear Mappings and Matrices
desc: bases mappings examples points

Linear mappings are functions taking vectors as input
and producing vectors as output, which provide an
easy-to-compute implementation of many intuitively
natural transformations of objects, such as size-change
(scaling) and rotation.  This introduction assumes a
basic grasp of vectors, including vector addition and
scalar multiplication, plus trigonometry for rotations.
