Here is a rather short introduction to vectors, in certain
respects rather philosophical, but also with reference
to QuArK's vector facilities.  The first few chapters of
books on 'vector calculus' are a good source for this
kind of material, although fortunately there's little need
to wade very far into them (I learned a lot from the one
by Marsden).
