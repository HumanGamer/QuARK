title: QFileObjects
author: Armin Rigo

QFileObject is an abstract class that inherits from QObject. The general rule is that classes that inherit from QFileObject can
be saved to or loaded from disk files, whereas classes that inherit from QObject only are internal objects whose purpose is
only to be used as subobjects of other objects.

For example, here is how a map file is internally organized. The ".map" file type itself is managed by a class called QMapFile
that inherits from QFileObject, whereas inside the map, the hierarchy of polyhedrons, groups, entities, etc. is represented by
a hierarchy of objects that inherit from QObject, because there is no point in saving these objects as single files.
Graphically :

<code>
Map object
 +-- worldspawn
      +-- polyhedron
      +-- polyhedron 2
      +-- group
           +-- entity
           +-- etc
</code>

The links in this diagram mean "is a sub-object".
