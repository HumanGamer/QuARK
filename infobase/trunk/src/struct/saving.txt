title: Saving files
author: Armin Rigo

Saving files is the exact inverse of loading them. The method <tt>SaveFile</tt> must turn the Specific/Args and the subobjects
structure back into a file.

If the <tt>LoadFile</tt> method used LoadSibling, <tt>SaveFile</tt> calls Info.WriteSibling (see QkMdl.pas).
