title: Hunting tools
author: DanielPharos

There are many tools out there that can be used to locate and
eliminate memory leaks.  Here's a small list of some of them,
and where to find them:

<strong>WinDBG (Debugging Tools for Windows)</strong><br>
Microsofts official debugging tools.  Might come in handy, but
it can only be used on the actual executable, and thus can
only be applied when searching for leaks the hard way, or for
locating crashes.

<strong>MemProof</strong><br>
A program that monitors the executable realtime, and lists
memory usage.  When the program finishes, all the memory still
being used has obviously leaked.

<strong>MemCheck</strong><br>
Being an alternative memory manager, this replaces the old
MemTester.pas that QuArK uses at the moment.  This has already
been done: all you need to do is to open the .dpr file in the
source directory, comment out MemTester, comment in MemCheck
AND the MemChk below at the end of the file, and you're done.

<strong>FastMM</strong><br>
Another alternative memory manager.  This one is actually so
good, that even Borland (developers of Delphi) started using
this in Delphi 2006!  But it's too good for QuArK: the amount
of leaks it finds, and the amount of crashes broken pointers
produce make the program unworkable.  These should (of course)
be fixed ASAP.
It has a settings file, source/prog/FastMM4Options.inc. To
enable the Full Debug Mode, you will need to place a DLL file
into your runtime directory.  See the FastMM readme file for
more information.

The alternative memory managers have already been installed into QuArK. You can enable them by editing the QuArK.dpr file and switch the comment-tags. You'll find them at the top of the listing (memory managers must be the first to load). Note: Only one can be enabled at a time!

Also, don't forget:<br>
There are a lot of debugging options already present in
Delphi (at least in 6 and higher).  Don't forget to check
the Project > Options > Compiler/Compiler Messages/Linker
settings in Delphi.  Also, some of these options have to
be enabled in order to use the full power of the tools
listed above.  Read the respective readme file that comes
with the tool for more information.
