title: Using dicts
author: DanielPharos

Another one, found out the hard way: the function 'dictspec'
(and probably 'dictitems' also) is leaking memory. This becomes
painfully obvious when called a LOT of times. The items inside
the dictionary might not have the correct reference counter set?

Example:
plugins/mdltools.py: (found in version 1.13, changed in version
1.14)<br>
Just change

<code>rulerlist[facenbr]['v']</code>

into:

<code>rulerlist[facenbr].dictspec['v']</code>

and see the memory slowly build up whenever you zoom or pan.
(Or just redraw!)

Update:
Should be fixed as of QuArK 6.6.0 Beta 1/2!
