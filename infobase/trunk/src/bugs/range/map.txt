<LI>Line 1877: A range check error occurs the first time this code
runs.  NbAretes2 (NumberFaces2) becomes negative, which further
down the line causes major problems.  This happens because ReallocMem
can change the pointer to the memory.  This code apparently was not
written with that in mind.  If you 'force' NbAretes2 to use the old
pointer value, a lot of other problems appears.  This problem could
be related to the views not drawing correctly on startup.<br>
<b>Fixed just after 6.6.0 Beta 4 release.</b>
