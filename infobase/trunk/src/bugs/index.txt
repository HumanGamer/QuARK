title: Known bugs in the Source Code
subdir: range leaks destroy

This section discusses the quality QuArK programming.  Over the years, many different people with a wide range
of coding quality have been working on the QuArK Source Code.  And because there is no such things as a program
without bugs (apart from Hello World maybe), there are a lot of bugs in the QuArK code.  Most can and should be
fixed on sight.  However, there are some bugs that are burrowed in the code, and probably there forever.

QuArK is written partly in Delphi and partly in Python, and available under the GNU General Public Licence -- see
<ref> src/sf </ref>.
