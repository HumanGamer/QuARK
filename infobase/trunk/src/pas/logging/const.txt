title: Constants

<code>
  LOG_FILENAME = 'QUARK.LOG';
  LOG_PATCHFILE = 'PATCH.TXT';

  LOG_ALWAYS = 0;
  LOG_CRITICAL = 10;
  LOG_WARNING = 20;
  LOG_INFO = 30;
  LOG_VERBOSE = 40;
</code>

All these constants are used by the logging procedures or their callers.

<tt>LOG_FILENAME</tt> is the filename of the logfile. The path of the logfile is set in <tt>OpenLogFile</tt>.<br>
<tt>LOG_PATCHFILE</tt> is not used anymore.

<tt>LOG_*</tt> are a bunch of constants that define the default verbose output levels. Their names describe when the log-line what kind of info it contains. See <tt>Log</tt> for more info about what this means.
