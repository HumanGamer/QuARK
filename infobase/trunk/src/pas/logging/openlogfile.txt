<code>
Procedure OpenLogFile;
</code>

This procedure opens and clears the logfile.

It first checks if there already is a log open (using the boolean <tt>LogOpened</tt>). If not, it then either creates a new file, or opens an existing file and blanks it. The filename is <tt>GetQPath(pQuArK)+LogFilename</tt>. It then invokes the procedure that outputs the system details into the logfile.
