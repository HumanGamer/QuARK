title:  Qk1.pas
author: tiglari

Qk1 and its form Form1 (an instance of TForm1, descendent
of TQkForm, descendant
of the standard Delphi c;ass TForm), kick off initializing
Quark - TForm1 is the main window; its Create method FormCreate
(the OnCreate event handler for a TForm1, as you can see
by looking in Qk1.dfm, the which defines the setup of a
TForm1) initializes
Python, sets up the main explorer window, and heaps of
other things.  Read the Delphi help on OnCreate.

<p>The handlers for the various Main Menu items are all there
(opening/saving files, cut/paste in the tree-view), tho
you should not have to mess with any of this stuff in order
to support a new file-type for example (you do that by
defining a subclass of QkFileObject and redefining methods,
as discussed in the <a href="src.struct.html#fileobjects">
fileobjects</a> section).

<p>The Toolbars containing the main menus at the left and
right of the main window are set up in Form1 itself,
defined in Qk1.dfm, also the menus.  The buttons are
defined in defaults.qrk, in Tool bars|Main.toolbar,
which is put into the topdock control by
the line:
<pre>
 RestorePositionTb('Main', False, Explorer);
</pre>
in Tform1.FormCreate (QkForm.pas).  Lines of this form can be used to put
additional button toolbars into the main window (with names
other then 'Main').

The actions of the buttons are defined by their cmd:macro values; the msg specifies of these
become the cmd parameter to the method TQkForm.MacroCommand
(QkForm.pas).

For those who aren't really up on how delphi programs work,
TForm1 is fired up by the Quark5.dpr file, which you
can look at in Pascal Source form by opening up the project
manager, then RMB|View Source on the Quark5.exe item
(from which all the various modules hang as dependents).
Or in fact you can just look at it with a text editor.
You'll see a long list of `uses' statements, followed by
a few lines of the kind of code that's normally used to
fire up GUI applications built with class libraries.

<p>
The line:
<pre>
  Application.CreateForm(TForm1, Form1);
</pre>
is responsible for setting up <strong>everything</strong>
that distinguishes QuArK from other Delphi applications
(with the uses statement marshalling the resources).




Query:  what does the `idle job' stuff do?

What else should we know about Qk1?
