title: Idle jobs
author: Armin Rigo

The 'idle job' is what runs when the application is idle, i.e. has nothing else
to do. Qk1.pas defines general methods to register new idle jobs, which will be
performed step-by-step -- every time the application is idle, a little bit of
the job is performed (through the AppIdle method). This is only used for the
texture browser, whose idle job consists of filling the texture pages (in
QkWad.pas), one texture at a time. This is done as an idle job so that it can
be interrupted by the user. I found it more convenient to do it like this
instead of starting a new thread that would load textures in parallel with
normal program execution, mainly because there are a number of issues with
multiple threads accessing the same internal data at the same time.
