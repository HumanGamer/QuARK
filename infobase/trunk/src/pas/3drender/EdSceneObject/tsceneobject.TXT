title: The 'TSceneObject' class
author: Decker

Let me see, if I can explain what this class is all about. Mind you, I have not understanded it completly, so
parts of this look-through explanation may be completly wrong.

The idea of
<tt>
TSceneObject
</tt>
is to encapsulate the complex data structures and 3D-render API calls, in a general class interface for QuArK to use.

It does not contain any code for a specific 3D-render, so one has to inherit from it and create a specialized class.

The main function calls into this abstract class are the following:

<code>
procedure Init( ... ); virtual; abstract;
procedure BuildScene( ... );
procedure Render3DView; virtual; abstract;
procedure AddPolyFace( ... );
procedure AddModel( ... );
procedure AddBezier( ... );
procedure AddLight( ... ); virtual;
</code>

<head>
procedure Init( ... ); virtual; abstract;
</head>

This function must; initialize the window, setup default data-structures and options, and ready the 3D-render API calls
by for instance load a DLL.

It is not defined in the TSceneObject class, as can be seen on the
<tt>
abstract
</tt>
keyword. So all classes that inherit from TSceneObject, must define the contents of this function.
