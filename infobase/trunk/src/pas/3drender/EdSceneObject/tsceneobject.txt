title: The 'TSceneObject' class
author: Decker, DanielPharos

Let me see, if I can explain what this class is all about. Mind you, I have not
understanded it completly, so parts of this look-through explanation may be
wrong. It's also very incomplete, but when you're working with the code, most
of it will explain itself.

The idea of <tt>TSceneObject</tt> is to encapsulate the complex data structures
and 3D-render API calls, in a general class interface for QuArK to use. This
makes it much easier to add additional renderers later, because the generic
interface with QuArK will be the same. It does not contain any code for a
specific 3D-render, so one has to inherit from it and create a specialized
class.

The main function calls into this abstract class are the following:

<tt>procedure Init( ... ); virtual; abstract;</tt>

This function must initialize the window, setup default data-structures and
options, and ready the 3D-render API calls by for instance load a DLL. It also
applies the settings from the Configuration, and saved the camera position.

It is not defined in the TSceneObject class, as can be seen on the
<tt>abstract</tt> keyword. So all classes that inherit from TSceneObject, must
define the contents of this function themselves.

<tt>procedure BuildScene( ... );</tt>

<tt>procedure Render3DView; virtual; abstract;</tt>

This procedure has to render the image data. It's also possible it has to
output the actual image to the screen, I'm not sure.

<tt>procedure AddPolyFace( ... );</tt>
