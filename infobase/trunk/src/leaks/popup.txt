title: Popup Menus
author: tiglari

The User|Menu|CreatePopup Menu error appears to be noncrititical.  11 popup
menus are created when the map editor is started, and not properly deleted
on closure but operation of the map editor does not seem to create more of
these errors.  The menu creation code is run when the buttons in the button
panel are pressed, but the resulting menus are propely deleted.

However, it would probably be good to attend to this someday, since these
popups, and one ordinary menu, are created and not deleted every time the
map editor is started, so if it's started once in a session you get 12
menu errors; twice, 24.
