title: Python Versions
author: tiglari

QuArK uses the ancient and honorable Python 1.5 (the 'minipy' is a minimal
installation of 1.5.1, although 1.5.2 also works).  Why so old?
Two reasons:
<UL>
<LI> It's a very small download (the .exe for Py2.x is about twice as big)
<LI> There are incompatiblities between Py1.5 and Py2.x that would require
      all users to upgrade their Python; this shouldn't be done without
      a strong immediate benefit.
</UL>

Nonetheless, in the longer term it will probably be a good idea to upgrade
the Python, possible reasons being:
<UL>
<LI> using tools like Psyco (Armin Rigo) and Pyrex (Greg Ewing) to
produce hi-performance plugins.
<LI> accessing libraries that have been linked to Python.
<LI> writing plugins in languages that can be linked to Python (this
in principle could be done for Py1.5, but some of the knowledge required
to write C extensions of Py1.5 appear to have been lost from the net).
<LI> Long Term Pipedream: rewriting much more of QuArK in Python, using
Psyco/PyPython tech to make it go fast enough (long-term as it is, this
might even be the best bet for making QuArK cross-platform).
</UL>
So, it is now possible to compile a QuArK .exe which will use Python 2.x;
to do this compile with the Conditional Define PYTHON22_OR_HIGHER set in
the Project|Options|Directories/Conditionals|Conditional Defines box.
The Conditional Define affects compilation of the files
<UL>
<LI>source/Python/Python.pas
<LI>source/Python/Pymath.pas
</UL>
Things are set up so that you could also compile for PYTHON21_OR_HIGHER
or PYTHON20_OR_HIGHER, although I think this would actually be pointless.

So-compiled versions won't work unless the specified Python or higher is
installed.
