title: Valve Mapversion 220
author: tiglari

The Valve Mapversion 220 map format used by WorldCraft 3.3
uses texture-scale representation that is quite close
to the texinfo_t data structure used by qbsp.  This
consists of 2 axes lying in one of the three planes
normal to the axes, plus offsets, & the formula for
computing the texture coordinate of a point xyz on
a face is:
<code>
   u = x * u_axis.x + y * u_axis.y + z * u_axis.z + u_offset
   v = x * v_axis.x + y * v_axis.y + z * v_axis.z + v_offset
</code>

in QkMap, Valve220MapParams does the job of writing in QkMapPoly.
