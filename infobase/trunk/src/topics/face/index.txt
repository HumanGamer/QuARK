title: Face Formats
desc: classic etp tv6 bp valve220

Here are described various aspects of face formats, which are of relevance
to the code in QkMapPoly.pas and QkMap.pas.  Especially the relationship
between QuArK's original internal representation (Quark etp) and the
'Classic Quake' map format(s), and the new internal/.qrk/.qkm representation.
The first three sections are of most importance to QuArK programmers, while
the ones on Brush Primitives and Valve Mapversion 220 are more cursory.
