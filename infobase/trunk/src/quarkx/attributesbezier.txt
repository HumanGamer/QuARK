title: Attributes of Internal objects of class "Bezier"
author: Armin Rigo

These objects are Bezier patches (for Quake 3). They can actually represent any "quilt" of <tt>m</tt> times
<tt>n</tt> joined quadratic Bezier patches, where <tt>m</tt> or
<tt>n</tt> can be zero (for Bezier lines).

For more information about Bezier patches see <ref> src/pas/bezier </ref>.

This read/write attribute lists all control points of the Bezier face. It is a tuple of tuples of 5D vectors, making a rectangular array of control points. Both dimensions of the rectangle are odd numbers. When writing to this attribute, the following rules apply: the tuples can be replaced by lists, and the vectors can be 3D only (in which case the old texture coordinates are not modified).
