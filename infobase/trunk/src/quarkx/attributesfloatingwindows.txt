title: Additionnal attributes of Floating Windows controls
author: Armin Rigo

Floating windows are created by a window’s newfloating() method. They are screen controls, and as all screen controls are, they
are attached to their owner window. Unlike other screen controls, however, they can float anywhere on the screen and are never
automatically aligned by a parent panel. In fact, their parent attribute is always None.
