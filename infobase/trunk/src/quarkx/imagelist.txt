title: Image List objects
author: Armin Rigo

Image Lists are built with the function quarkx.loadimages. They are similar to immutable sequences of icons, but only the
following operations are defined on them:

<table border=1 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=4>

<tr><td class="doccode">
len(imagelist)
</td><td>
The length (how many images the list contains)
</td></tr>

<tr><td class="doccode">
imagelist[i]
</td><td>
The ith image, starting at 0
</td></tr>

</table>

Do not use Image List objects in places where a sequence could normally be used, e.g. in for. Instead of
<code>
for icon in imagelist:
  ...
</code>
write
<code>
for i in range(0, len(imagelist)):
  icon = imagelist[i]
  ...
</code>
