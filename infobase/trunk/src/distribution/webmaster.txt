author: DanielPharos

There are some steps only the webmaster can perform, because it involves modifying things on the QuArK website. These are:

<ol>
<li>Make sure there's a news-announcement on the SourceForge-page.</li>
<li>If this is the new recommended build, mark it as such in SourceForge downloads.</li>
<li>If new game support was added, update the description on SourceForge to reflect the new number of games supported.</li>
<li>Add the new QuArK release to the website's database.</li>
<li>If this is the new recommended build, make sure that indicated on the website download page as well.</li>
<li>Copy the news-announcement to the website, and publish it there too. Make sure to link to the correct download.</li>
<li>And publish it on the quark-news mailing list as well.</li>
<li>If needed, update the random-news-blurb about the latest release on the forums.</li>
<li>Update the online copy of the Infobase hosted on the website.</li>
<li>Contact any mirror-sites, so they can update their downloads.</li>
<li>Consider updating the release information on QuArK's Wikipedia page.</li>
</ol>
