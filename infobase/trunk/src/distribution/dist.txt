title: Releasing a Distribution
author: Peter Brett, DanielPharos

(I'm going to assume that you're running Windows.)

In preparation for creating a distribution, you'll need to carry out a
couple of preliminary steps.

<ol><li>Download and install Nullsoft Scriptable Install System (NSIS)
2.0 beta 4 or higher from 
<a href="http://nsis.sourceforge.net">http://nsis.sourceforge.net</a>.
</li>
<li>Checkout the <tt>utils</tt> module from QuArK CVS on SourceForge.
This module contains the scripts and other files you'll need to be
able to create the distribution.</li>
<li>Make sure you have access permissions to work with the SourceForge
release system.</li>
</ol>

So, once you've decided that you're ready to create a distribution,
here's what you do.

<ol>
<li>First, work out what the version number is for this distribution
(see <ref>src/distribution/policy</ref>). You'll probably need to
discuss with other developers to decide what the state is going to be
and whether to increment the the minor version, but for the sake of
argument lets say the version number you come up with is '6.4.1beta3'.
</li>
<li>For a distribtion, it's necessary to update the version numbers
in the QuArK executable. Go to the Project > Options > Version Info
and update the numbers. Don't forget the copyright year!<br>
Also, some const's in QkObjects need to be updated. Check them out
and update where needed:
<code>
  QuArKVersion
  QuArKMinorVersion
  QuArKCopyright
  QuArKUsedCompiler
  QuArKCompileDate
</code></li>
<li>Most of creating a distribution is similar to creating a snapshot.
First, do steps 1 to 3 of <ref>src/distribution/snapshot</ref>, with
the difference that you name the files with the '6.4.1beta3' instead
of the date, so <tt>quark-win32-20070831</tt> becomes
<tt>quark-win32-6.4.1beta3</tt>.</li>
<li>Open up your local copy of <tt>QuArK.nsi</tt>. You'll need to
make some changes there:
<ol>
<li>Update the version numbers:
<code>!define INSTALLER_EXENAME "quark-win32-6.4.1beta3.exe"
!define PRODUCT_VERSION "6.4.1 beta 3"
InstallDir "$PROGRAMFILES\QuArK 6.4.1 beta 3"
</code></li>
<li>Set the path to the files to create the installer with:
<code>!define BUILDDIR "C:\QuArK_installer_files"</code>
It is advisable to simply create this directory and copy the files into
it manually.</li>
<li>Set the path to the installer images:
<code>!define SPLASHDIR "C:\QuArK_installer_splash_image"</code></li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Run the <tt>QuArK.nsi</tt> script. If you selected this option during
the NSIS installation, right-clicking the file should provide you with
that option. If not, open up <tt>QuArK.nsi</tt> in NSIS and create the
installer there.</li>
<li>It's not a bad idea to run some tests at this point. Test the
installer, and make sure the new release does not have any obvious
bugs.</li>
<li>Zip up the source and infobase directories just as with the snapshot.
Again: no fancy zip-compressions!</li>
<li>Now create the release in SourceForge (see <ref>src/distribution/snapshot</ref>
for more details about this).</li>
<li>Create a news-announcement on the SourceForge-page.</li>
<li>Tell the webmaster of the QuArK website to do the same. (It's probably
smart to have similar text in both.)</li>
</ol>
