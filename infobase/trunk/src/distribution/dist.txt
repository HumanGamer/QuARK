title: Releasing a Distribution
author: Peter Brett

I'm going to assume you've followed the SourceForge guidelines for
setting up SSH access to the shell server and you're using PuTTY. I'm
also going to assume that the date is 31st August 2007, and you're
running Windows. 

In preparation for creating a distribution, you'll need to carry out a
couple of preliminary steps.

<ol><li>Download and install Nullsoft Scriptable Install System (NSIS)
2.0 beta 4 or higher from 
<a href="http://nsis.sourceforge.net">http://nsis.sourceforge.net</a>.
</li>
<li>Checkout the <tt>utils</tt> module from QuArK CVS on SourceForge.
This module contains the scripts and other files you'll need to be
able to create the distribution.</li>
<li>Make sure you have access permissions to work with the SourceForge
release system.</li>
</ol>

So, once you've decided that you're ready to create a distribution,
here's what you do.

<ol>
<li>First, work out what the version number is for this distribution
(see <ref>src/distribution/policy</ref>). You'll probably need to
discuss with other developers to decide what the state is going to be
and whether to increment the the minor version, but for the sake of
argument lets say the version number you come up with is '6.4.1beta3'.
</li>
<li>Most of creating a distribution is similar to creating a snapshot.
First, do steps 1 to 11 of <ref>src/distribution/snapshot</ref>, with
the difference that you name the files with the '6.4.1beta3' instead
of the date, so <tt>quark-win32-20070831</tt> becomes
<tt>quark-win32-6.4.1beta3</tt>.</li>
<li>Move your <tt>quark-win32-6.4.1beta3.zip</tt> to your shell server home
directory.
<code>$ mv quark-win32-6.4.1beta3.zip ~/</code></li>
<li>Upload the source and help distributions to the release system's
incoming directory.
<code>$ ftp
ftp&gt; open upload.sourceforge.net
ftp&gt; binary
ftp&gt; put quark-src-6.4.1beta3.zip
ftp&gt; put quark-help-6.4.1beta3.zip
ftp&gt; quit</code></li>
<li>Use PSFTP to download your <tt>quark-win32-6.4.1beta3.zip</tt> to your
own computer.
<code>&gt; psftp shell.sourceforge.net
psftp&gt; get quark-win32-6.4.1beta3.zip
psftp&gt; quit</code></li>
<li>Create a new directory somewhere on your system - let's say
<tt>C:\qrkinstall</tt> - and copy the files from your checkout of
<tt>utils/nsis-dist-tools</tt> to that directory.  You will need:
<ul>
<li>install_header.bmp</li>
<li>install_splash.bmp</li>
<li>license.rtf</li>
<li>QuArK.nsi</li>
</ul>
Use your favourite archiving program to extract the files from your
<tt>quark-win32-6.4.1beta3.zip</tt> to <tt>C:\qrkinstall\quark</tt>.
</li>
<li>Open <tt>QuArK.nsi</tt> and edit the "QuArK Version" section as
applicable.  In this case, you'd want it to look something like this:
<code>!define QRK_MAJOR_VER 6.4
!define QRK_MINOR_VER 1
!define QRK_STATE "beta"
!define QRK_RELEASE 3
</code>
Save and close.
</li>
<li>Right click on <tt>QuArK.nsi</tt> in Windows Explorer and select "Compile
NSI (with bz2)".  Please use BZ2 compression, as it provides much better
compression ratios that ZIP (the default).</li>
<li>Upload the newly created <tt>quark-win32-6.4.1beta3.exe</tt> to the
incoming directory for the SourceForge release system.
<code>&gt; ftp
ftp&gt; open upload.sourceforge.net
ftp&gt; binary
ftp&gt; put quark-win32-6.4.1beta3.exe
ftp&gt; quit</code></li>
<li>All the distribution files (<tt>quark-src-6.4.1beta3.zip</tt>,
<tt>quark-help-6.4.1beta3</tt>, and <tt>quark-win32-6.4.1beta3</tt>)
are now ready for you to process them through the SourceForge release
system.  Don't forget that the release system upload directory is
flushed every 24 hours.</li>
</ol>

Once you've finished doing the release, it would probably be a good
idea to update the main QuArK website and to post an announcement to the
quark, quark-news and quark-python mailing lists, as well as adding
links to the snapshot webpage.
