title: Releasing a Distribution
author: Peter Brett, DanielPharos

Once you've decided that you're ready to create a distribution,
here's what you do.

<ol>
<li>First, make sure you have access permissions to work with the
SourceForge release system.</li>
<li>Then work out what the version number is for this distribution
(see <ref>src/distribution/policy</ref>). You'll probably need to
discuss with other developers to decide what the state is going to be
and whether to increment the the minor version, but for the sake of
argument lets say the version number you come up with is '6.4.1beta3'.
</li>
<li>Perform a clean check-out from the source code repository, to
make sure you're using the latest files without any uncommitted
changes.</li>
<li>For a distribution, it's necessary to update the version numbers
in the QuArK executable. Go to the Project > Options > Version Info
and update the numbers. Don't forget the copyright year, and the
pre-release-flag!<br>
Also, some const's in <tt>QkConsts.pas</tt> need to be updated. Check
them out and update them where needed:
<code>
  QuArKVersion
  QuArKMinorVersion
  QuArKCopyright
  QuArKUsedCompiler
  QuArKCompileDate
</code>
(The <tt>QuArKCompileDate</tt> can be determined by using the date
utility in utils\dateutil.)<br>
Additionally, there's two version indicators at the top in
runtime/addons/defaults.qrk that might need updating as well:
<code>
  Version
  InternalVersion
</code>
</li>
<li>Make sure that the Project > Options > Directories/Conditionals:
Conditional Defines are set correctly.</li>
<li>Most of creating a distribution is similar to creating a snapshot.
First, do steps 1 to 3 of <ref>src/distribution/snapshot</ref>, with
the difference that you name the files with the '6.4.1beta3' instead
of the date, so <tt>quark-win32-20070831</tt> becomes
<tt>quark-win32-6.4.1beta3</tt>.</li>
<li>For official releases, the update checker will probably get a
new notification so that QuArK will tell people to update. Increasing
the <tt>Notification_Main</tt> number under <tt>Startup:config</tt>
in the Defaults.qrk file will prevent people that install the new
version from receiving this notification too.</li>
<li>Open up your local copy of <tt>QuArK.nsi</tt>. You'll need to
make some changes there:
<ol>
<li>Update the version numbers:
<code>!define INSTALLER_EXENAME "quark-win32-6.4.1beta3.exe"
!define PRODUCT_VERSION "6.4.1 beta 3"
InstallDir "$PROGRAMFILES\QuArK 6.4.1 beta 3"
</code></li>
<li>Set the path to the files to create the installer with:
<code>!define BUILDDIR "C:\QuArK_installer_files"</code>
It is advisable to simply create this directory and copy the files into
it manually.</li>
<li>Set the path to the installer images:
<code>!define SPLASHDIR "C:\QuArK_installer_splash_image"</code></li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>If you are making an official release, don't forget to commit the
updated <tt>QuArK.nsi</tt> file to the source code repository.</li>
<li>Create the installer; see <ref>src/distribution/installer</ref>.</li>
<li>It's not a bad idea to run some tests at this point. Test the
installer, and make sure the new release does not have any obvious
bugs.</li>
<li>Zip up the source and infobase directories just as with the snapshot.
Again: no fancy zip-compressions!</li>
<li>Now create the release in SourceForge (see <ref>src/distribution/snapshot</ref>
for more details about this).</li>
<li>Don't forget to add the README.txt file to the release files as well!</li>
<li>Create a news-announcement on the SourceForge-page.</li>
<li>Tell the webmaster of the QuArK website to do the same. (It's probably
smart to have similar text in both.)</li>
</ol>
