title: Releasing a Snapshot
author: Peter Brett, DanielPharos

Here's the process you might follow to prepare and release a snapshot.
Before you'll be able to follow the process outlined below, you'll probably want to read <a href="http://alexandria.wiki.sourceforge.net/File+Release+System+-+Offering+Files+for+Download">File Release System - Offering Files for Download</a> to know how to work with the SourceForge File Release System.

<ol>
<li>Make a copy of the <tt>runtime</tt>, <tt>source</tt> and <tt>infobase</tt> directories you want to release.</li>
<li>Build a QuArK binary from this source directory.</li>
<li>Please save the QuArK.map file, if it was generated. This will allow converting from memory addresses back to Delphi functions if a crash is reported.</li>
<li>Put the new QuArK binary in the main runtime directory.</li>
<li>Make sure that there are no stray files in the runtime directory, such as generated .pyc files.</li>
<li>Built the new infobase by running its build.py (with the -local parameter).</li>
<li>Delete the old runtime\help and copy the output from the infobase build there instead (and name this folder correctly!).</li>
<li>Zip up the directory, each to a different zip-file, using the scheme from <ref>src/distribution/policy</ref>. No fancy zip-compressions, please! Any plain old unzipper should be able to unzip the files. If possible, use the Windows XP built-in zip functionality; this creates a pretty common denominator zip-file.</li>
<li>Create a new snapshot-release in the QuArK-package using the SourceForge File Release System. Name this release 'snapshot YYYY-MM-DD', and add the zip-files to that new release. Don't forget to set the 'specifics' on the files correctly!</li>
<li>Make sure the new release is 'Active', and visible on the SourceForge website.</li>

You should also e-mail a release announcement to the development mailing list (<a href="mailto:quark-python@yahoogroups.com">quark-python@yahoogroups.com</a>), something along the lines of: (I'm going to assume that the date is 31st August 2007)

<code>Subject: Snapshots 20070831

Read through and summarize the NEWS.txt file to compile a changelog.

It's also a good idea only to have four snapshots on the site at a time, so as to be sure not to exceed the storage quota.  So delete the oldest snapshots if you need to.
