title: Creating the installer

(I'm going to assume that you're running Windows.)

In preparation for creating the installer, you'll need to carry out a couple of preliminary steps.

<ol><li>Download and install Nullsoft Scriptable Install System (NSIS) 2.0 beta 4 or higher from <a href="http://nsis.sourceforge.net">http://nsis.sourceforge.net</a>.
</li>
<li>Checkout the <tt>utils</tt> module from QuArK CVS on SourceForge. This module contains the scripts and other files you'll need to be able to create the distribution.</li>
</ol>

There are several steps in creating the installer:
<ol>
<li>Change "INSTALLER_EXENAME" to the name of the installer executable file.</li>
<li>Change "PRODUCT_VERSION" to match the new version number.</li>
<li>Change "InstallDir" to the new Program Files location.</li>
<li>Create an empty folder (here we'll use "QuArK_installer_files" in the C:\ directory).</li>
<li>Change "BUILDDIR" to the name of this new folder.</li>
<li>Place the QuArK.exe, all runtime files and the help folder in the above folder.</li>
<li>Create an empty folder (here we'll use "QuArK_installer_splash_image" in the C:\ directory).</li>
<li>Copy the install_header.bmp and install_splash.bmp files from utils\nsis-dist-tools folder to the above folder.</li>
<li>Run the <tt>QuArK.nsi</tt> script. If you selected this option during the NSIS installation, right-clicking the file should provide you with that option. If not, open up NSIS.exe to start program
select "MakeNSISW (compiler interface)", and drag the <tt>QuArK.nsi</tt> file into the compiler window, or use the "File > Load Script" method to open this file.</li>
<li>The finished QuArK installer will be place in the same location as this file, ready for distribution!</li>
</ol>

This will produce the installer executable in the same folder as where <tt>QuArK.nsi</tt> is located.
