title: Python Coding
subdir: duplicators

To code the Python, all you need is a decent text-editor (Textpad, UltraEdit,
etc) and QuArK; an altered Python file is recompiled automatically the
next time your run QuArK.  If you tick the Developer Mode option and
restart QuArK, a somewhat limited 'reload' command will also appear on
the command menu, which reloads modules.  The
<ref>src/quarkx</ref> section of this document describes the Delphi
facilities you can call from Python; unfortuately there is no similar
account of the facilities that the Python modules provide for each other,
so that figuring out how to do things in QuArK Python is not always so
easy.  As far as learning Python itself is concerned, SAMS publications
<I>Teach Yourself Python in 24 Hours</I> (Ivan van Lanigham) is one that
people have had good experiences with.

Note that QuArK uses python 1.5.1 or .2; the Minipy is a 1.5.1 .dll,
and if it is present QuArK will use it, but will also work if 1.5.2 is
installed, but <i>not</i> Python 2.  The Minipy is however perfectly
happy to coexist with a Python 2 installation.
