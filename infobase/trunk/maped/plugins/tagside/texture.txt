The next submenu we'll look at is concerned with 'texture wrapping',
fitting textures across more than one face without seams;
perhaps with a bit of fitting as well.  The commands of the
Texture Wrapping submenu are:

<UL>
<LI><b>Wrap texture from tagged</b> - copies the texture from the tagged
face onto this one, so that there are no seams where the faces
meet.  No scaling or distortions are performed.  This is fine
for wrapping a texture around a vertical edge, but would work
out for say an obelisk.

<LI>Wrap texture <b>Around pillar</b> - Tag a face that's the side of
a pillar, then select the one next to it. Bring up the Texture Wrap
Multiplier. Set the number of times the texture is to be repeated
as it is wrapped and <u><b>do not</b></u> close the multiplier
window. Reselect the face next to the tagged one and activate the
Around pillar function.  The texture on the tagged face will be
wrapped all the way around the pillar, in the direction of the
pillar, and scaled to fit seamlessly. This only works if the edges
where the faces to be wrapped around are all parallel
(the whole pillar can however be at a slant).
When the operation can't be performed, the item is disabled.

<LI>Fit texture <b>Across tagged</b> - this is a bit like the pillar wrap,
but here you tag a set of faces (using 'Add to tagged' from the
More tagging submenu or 'Tag Toolbar'), then select the one you want to (copy) wrap from (which should be at one end).  The texture
of that face will be copied to the others, and scaled
so that it fits a full number of times across all the faces. If you want the selected texture to be 'spread across' the other faces, use the 'Texture Wrap Multiplier' as discribed above.
Like the pillar wrap, this only works if the edges joining the
faces are all parallel, and is disabled if it can't work.

<LI><b>Project texture from tagged</b> - this is a new one.  Suppose
you want to wrap a mesh like texture over a bunch of random faces making
various angles with each other (like a mesh stretched over a
jumble of stuff).  None of the above methods will work, but this
will.  The texture of the tagged face is projected onto the
selected face, so that a texture is projected from one face
to several faces hooked up in complicated ways, it will seem to
be wrapped smoothly over all of them.  So that for example you can do
a four-sided obelisk by projecting textures from parallel
brushes that project onto the obelisk faces but are ignored
for building the map.  I think I have fixed the problem of things not working if the projected-from brush was not
big enough.
</UL>

There are also two options on the menu, the useful one is
'preserve aspect ratio'; if this is checked, the fitting operations
resize the textures evenly in all dimensions to make them fit
in the pillar wrap and fit across tagged operations; otherwise
they are just stretched  in the direction required.  The other
one is 'shift tag to selected', which might causes the selected
tagged to become the tagged face in the Wrap texture from tagged
operation.
