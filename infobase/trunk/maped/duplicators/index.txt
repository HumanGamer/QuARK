title: Duplicators
subdir: basic path

Duplicators mean that if you use Quark, you'll never need
to make 26 copies of a complicated object, then make
new ones when you realize that all of them ought to
be different.  With a duplicator, you have one original,
and when it is updated, the copies follow automatically.

Although the basic function of Duplicators is to make copies, 
they can do much more and come in many varieties. First
we talk about the 'standard duplicators', then an assortment
of more special types.
