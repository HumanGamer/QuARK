Sometimes you might want to create some sort of complicated sub-assembly to
connect the segments of the path duplicator (for example to solve texture
alignment problems by having custom textures on the joins).  Elbow-space can
be created with the 'squarend' and 'setback' specifics (of the duplicator itself,
not the containing group).

Next, if the angles of the joins are all the same, you can use the 'elbow'
duplicator to make multiple copies of the joining structure, suitably
rotated.  Pushing the elbow button drops an elbow duplicator into the group,
which uses the same path points as the path duplicator itself.  Into this duplicator
put the structure you want to be replicated at the elbows, locating it at the
first elbow (space between first and second path segments).  It might be easier
to line things up if you dissociate the images of the path duplicator first; then
you can use tag & glue operations to join things up (I have tested that the results
can seal against the void).

Combined use of the elbows and the 'level' specific could be a reasonable way to
deal with the problem of making a corridor or path that both rises and turns
(horizonatally) at the joints, without twisiting.
