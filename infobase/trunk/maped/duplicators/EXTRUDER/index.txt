title: Extruder
author: tiglari

The extruder has overlapping functionality with the
<ref>maped/duplicators/path</ref>, but lacks
some of its features, and has additional ones of its own (it's a different
kind of implementation, with different potential).  Some significant strengths
of the extruder are:
<ul>
<li>it has 2d editing facilities (either a special 2d editing window, or
  circumference handles in a normal view) for controlling the shape of the
  outline, which can be a hollow or solid (including concave) pipe, a patch
  tube, or pipe with an outside square and inside complex outine).
<li>it has a variety of faclities for positioning path points with respect
  to each other (rmb on the path points).
<li>it can automatically punch holes in things that it goes thru, both for the
  inner and the outer circumference.
</ul>
To texture, it, dissociate the images, arrange the textures on the first section,
then revert it back to being a duplicator.

If you want to use the extruder 2d/outline editing features in combination with
the features of the path duplicator, you can put a one-segment extruder into
a path-duplicator's template group, and the shape will be extruded along the
path.
