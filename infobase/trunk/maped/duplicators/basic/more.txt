title: More Duplicators
author: tiglari

There are seven more Standard Duplicators beyond the Basic
Duplicator.  One of them, the Linear Duplicator, is
an enhanced version of the Basic Duplicator; we'll talk
about it last.  Then there is Copy One and 5 mirror
duplicators.

Copy One makes a single copy, which you can put where you
want.  If you want to make a small number of copies, and
put them in assorted places (perhaps a few crates scattered
around in a room), you can put several Copy One duplicators
into the same group; each will make its own copies of the
things in the group, which you can locate with the blue
handles (notice however that if several duplicators are
located in the same group, they don't copy each other).

Copy One is fine for making small numbers of copies, but for
larger numbers, the more complex Instance Duplicator would
be better.

The mirror duplicators make copies located symmetrically
around an axis that passes through the duplicator
(equivalently, reflected in the plane perpendicular to
the axis).  There are Mirror X, Mirror Y and Mirror Z,
each making one copy, and Mirror XY, making three (so there
are either two or four shapes in all).  What if what you
want is say 4 structures in XZ, or 8 in all in XYZ?
There's a way to do that which we'll see in
<ref> ./combinations </ref>
below.

The last of the standard duplicators is the Linear Duplicator,
whose special features are somewhat advanced, so we
talk about them in
<ref> ./linear </ref>
below.
