If you plan on using anyone of the below mentioned macro-objects; Digger,
Negative brush, Duplicator, Copy-One or Mirror, you must use groups!

Since a macro-object apply its effects/actions to the group it is
positioned in, and all of its sub-groups, it will be impossible to use
the objects, if you don't use groups.

Another good point for using groups is, that this will allow you to move many
brushes and entities, in just one movement. Just select the group of objects
you want to move, and move them in the 2D-views.

At the moment, it is not possible in QuArK to lock brushes/entities in a
group, so when you select a brush/entity in the 2D-view which belongs to the
group, the entire group is selected instead. To do this, you have to first
select the group in the tree-view, and then move it in the 2D-views, or use
the <ref> maped/plugins/madsel/extend </ref> functionality.

With groups, you can also hide their contents from the 2D-views, or just gray
it out. To do this, select the group in the tree-view, right-click to get its
context-menu up, and select between:

<ul>
<li>Group is visible
<li>Group is grayed out
<li>Group is hidden
</ul>

Notice that the last option, will also automatically select "Hide on textured
views" and "Cannot select with the mouse". This way you won't accidently select
parts of your map, that you can't currently see in the 2D-views.

You can also give a group a color to illustrate different things. Again in the
context-menu you can choose the Group color, which will bring up
a color-choice dialog.
