If you think, that to create a hole in a brush, you have to brush-subtract
(carve), then think again when using QuArK!

A very powerful feature in QuArK,
is the ability to use diggers and negative polys, which first does the real
brush-subtraction when you compile your map. This lets you experiment placing a
hole if you're not quite sure about its position, without messing with
brush-subtraction and more brushes than necessary.

A digger and negative poly will only create holes in brushes of the
<ref> ./grouptechniques \ same group </ref>, or sub-groups of that group, that
they exists in.

There are no actual difference between a digger macro and a negative poly,
other than in the tree-view you can see the Digger object. You can't see a
negative poly, unless you rename it by selected it in the tree-view, and press
the F2 key.

In the 2D-view, these cubes will be drawn with a different line-color
(See also <ref> intro/configuration/map/colors </ref>.)

The texture of a face on a digger or negative poly, will be applied to the
brush that is carved, but only if that brush hasn't already been carved
or cut at that coplanar plane that the face of the digger/negative poly will
carve/cut it at. This can get tricky at times, and depends on which
digger/negative poly does the first carving/cut.

Example: In the image to the right, there are two negative polys both with
different textures (RED, BLUE), and two normal brushes.

After the negative polys have done their job (during compile), it may look like
this in the game:

<ul>
<li>The cut-lines <b>1</b>, <b>3</b> and <b>C</b> will get their texture from
    the negative polys' faces.
<li>The cut-line <b>A</b> will keep its texture, because it was already
    <i>cut</i> beforehand.
<li>The cut-lines <b>2</b> and <b>B</b> will get their textures from the
    negative poly who <u>first</u> does the carving/cut. In this case, the face
    <b>B12</b> became RED and face <b>B23</b> became BLUE, but face <b>2AB</b>
    is still RED.
</ul>
