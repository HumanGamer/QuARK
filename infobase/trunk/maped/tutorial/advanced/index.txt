This is the fourth and final part, which guides you through the methods and
functions of creating a map in QuArK's map-editor. You should have read
<ref> ../starting \ the first part </ref>,
<ref> ../polyhedrons \ second part </ref> and
<ref> ../entities \ third part </ref> before going through this fourth part.

The advanced stuff is optional, but learning these can help you set up your
maps faster than normal.
