Now your tree-view might look something like as in this image to the right:

Imagine what would happen, when you have 400+ brushes like that. How on earth
are you going to know what brush are related to what?

This is where groups are used. You can group together, those brushes and
entities which, e.q. belongs to a single room, an advanced multi-segmented
door, a vehicle which consists of many brushes, etc.

To group brushes and entities, you first select the ones which should be
grouped together. Then you press the

Try to group your 6 brushes, which is your room. The tree-view should show you
something similar as shown in this image:

You can of cause give the group a more meaningfull name, by selecting the
group-object, and press the F2 key, or slowly double-clicking on it. (Just like
in Windows' File-Explorer.)

I would suggest you rename your newly created group to: <tt>My first room</tt>.

There are some special things you can do with groups, but that is explained in
the <ref> ../advanced/grouptechniques </ref>. However, if you are curious, just
right-click on the group-object, to get its context-menu up.
