It would be quite a dull level, if you only used one <g>texture</g>. So how do
we change the texture on a brush?

First the brush(es) must be selected. When they are selected, the
<ref> intro/mapeditor/dataforms/polyhedronview </ref> will appear
instead of the tree-view, showing you some information about the selected
brush(es) and the texture, as shown in the image.

To change the texture on the whole brush, press on the <b>choose texture</b>
icon <img width=24 height=22 align=absmiddle>image12.png</img>, or right-click
on the brush to get a <b>context menu</b> up, where you can select
<b>Texture...</b>

In the <a href="../texturebrowser/index.html">texture-browser</a>, you can
browse (wow!) through the available textures, and select the one you want
assigned to the brush(es). You select a texture by double-clicking on it in the
texture-browser.

To change the texture on just one face, you select the face by clicking on its
face-handle. The same handle you used to size the brush with.

Again, to change the texture, press on the <b>choose texture</b> icon
<img width=25 height=23 align=absmiddle>image14.png</img>, or right-click on
the face-handle to get a context menu up, where you can select
<b>Texture...</b>

This should be enough introduction for you, to mess around with texturing the
rest of your cubes. Try also to assign different textures to each face of a
cube, and see what happens.
