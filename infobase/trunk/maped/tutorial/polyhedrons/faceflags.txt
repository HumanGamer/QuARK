title: Face-flags
author: Decker

Quake-2 introduced face-flags for brushes, which controls; transparency, water,
sky, clip, currents and some other stuff.

QuArK will show you this icon
<img width=27 height=22 align=absmiddle>image15.png</img> in the same row as
the above mentioned 2 icons, but only when the selected game you have choosen,
supports these face-flags.
