There is another little feature in QuArK. You can have any of the
<ref> intro/mapeditor/dataforms \ data views</ref> open at all times. You do
this by clicking on the tap for the view, and drag it to the place you want to
drop it at.

Try to do it as shown in the image. Drag the
<ref> intro/mapeditor/dataforms/specsargsview \ specifics/args view </ref>
out, and drop it somewhere.

Okay, so whats this specific/arg thingy then? Well, all entities requires some
parameters, which the game-engine uses to figure out what the entity is and
what it is supposed to do. These parameters are called <tt>specifics</tt> and
<tt>arguments</tt> in QuArK. You could call them the entity's variables and
values, if you want it in programming-terms.

A specific that must always exist for every entity, is the <tt>classname</tt>
specific. This is the 'variable-name' that the game-engine knows about, and ask
what its argument (value) is. In the case where you have created a
info_player_start entity, the classname argument is <tt>info_player_start</tt>,
and so the game-engine knows that this entity will act as a info_player_start,
and runs code to make it so.

QuArK uses the argument of the classname specific in its tree-view. You can try
to rename the info_player_start object in the tree-view, and see that it will
also change in the specifics/args view too. Remember to undo your changes, so
the info_player_start comes back again.

Some point-entities require a point in 3D-space, to know where it must exist.
This is the <tt>origin</tt> specific. It has tree arguments; X, Y and Z. QuArK
has to know this origin, in order to show the entity in the 2D-views. However,
since you can control the position of point-entities in the 2D-views, you never
have to modify the arguments for the origin specific.

There is also another specific that QuArK knows about; <tt>angle</tt>. Whenever
this specific is present in the entity's specifics/args view and have an
argument, and you have selected then entity, the <tt>entity pointing angle</tt>
(ball-handle) will appear in the 2D-views. Try to change info_player_start's
angle argument to some other value between 0 and 360. You will notice that the
ball-handle will reflect the change.

Setting values for an entity, is just the matter of typing them into the
argument of the correct specifics, or selecting the proper checkboxes or
listbox-items, that is shown in the specifics/args view for the entity. Notice
that the listboxes are editable, so if you can't find an item in the list, you
have to type it yourself.

You can add new specifics to your entity, by clicking on the <tt>plus icon</tt>
in the specifics/args view. This will give you a new line, where you have to
rename the specific and give it an argument. You can of cause also delete a
specific/arg by first selecting the specific and press the <tt>minus icon</tt>.
