title: What's the deal with WC 3.3 & mapversion 220
author: tiglari

Quark now reads (as of version 6.2) the new mapversion 220
format of worldcraft 3.3, and if a map's worldspawn
element has a "mapversion" specific with value "220",
it will be written in this format.  If you want to read
in 220 and write in the regular map format, remove the
"mapversion" specific.
