Can I use other entities in conjunction with this turret?

I don't think so. Maybe you can try putting other monsters over the
rotating objects; but they would still behave as normal monsters. I think
the turret_driver cannot be changed into something else. I don't think
you can have other func_xxx objects work together with the turret at all.
