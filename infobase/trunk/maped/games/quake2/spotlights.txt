<b>Question:</b><br>
When creating a spotlight, using the "info_null" entity,
it is possible to set a "cone"-value in the specifics of the light_entity
as well as in the specifics of the info_null-entity?

<b>Answer:</b><br>
It seems that only the light's "_cone" works. It must be a mistake to
have a "_cone" field in the info_null.

For your question; yes, this is the size of the cone of light that is emitted when the light's
"target" points to an "info_null" entity. The light is emitted in the direction
of the "info_null" entity. The "_cone" field is the angle, in degrees.
