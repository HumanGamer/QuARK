<b>Question:</b><br>
When using FreeImage as the loading library, why do certain PCX file
don't load correctly as seem to have a randomized color palette?

<b>Answer:</b><br>
This is a known issue with some Quake 2 .PCX files; technically,
they are corrupt. Both QuArK and DevIL compensate for it, but
FreeImage doesn't, resulting in a corrupt palette. In other words:
don't use FreeImage for loading PCX files if you encounter this issue.
