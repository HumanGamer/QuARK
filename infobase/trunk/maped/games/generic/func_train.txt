title: Func_train entity

<html><b>Question:</b><br>
I am experimenting with a func_train and I seem to be unable to predict the exact course that this thing
will follow after I put down the path_corners for it.

<html><b>Answer:</b><br>
The general path it will follow is set by the chain of target/targetname
that tie the path_corner entities together. When you click on one of the
path_corners, QuArK should display the whole path with arrows; if it doesn't,
there is something wrong in your target/targetnames, or
"show indirect 'target' links" isn't checked in QuArK's configuration.

Now to know exactly where the func_train will go: Its lower-left corner is the point that
follows the path_corners.
