How can I set the description that is displayed in the game-console while
loading the map? Like set "The Hall of Mirrors by XXX" instead of just the name of my .BSP file?

Double-click on 'worldspawn' in the map editor. Yes, this is also an
entity, and it also have Specific/Args. Find the 'message' specific, its the one you are looking for:
<code>
message         A Fab Map by XXX
</code>
