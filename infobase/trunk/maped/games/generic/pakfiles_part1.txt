title: .PAK files - Part I
author: Decker / Armin Rigo

<b>Question:</b><br>
If I built a level and I use my own textures
and my own recorded sounds in it, can I distribute the BSP-file of my
level without having to worry about that or do I have to include the textures
and WAV-files that I home-created in the ZIP-file along with a manual for
placing them correctly in the right directories as I have done on my computer?
I mean; are they automatically included in the .BSP during creation,
or does the .BSP merely point to those files, so that they
have to be placed in the
<i>insert-game-name-here</i>&nbsp;
directories of the people who want to play my level?

<b>Answer:</b><br>
The following game's .BSP files don't store the textures. You have to distribute
them together with it. The same is true for .WAV files. You can make a
.ZIP file with the directory structure intact if you want to spare the
trouble of putting the files in their correct directories from other users.
