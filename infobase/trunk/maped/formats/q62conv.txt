title: Conversion from QuArK 6.2
author: tiglari

Because the representation of texture scales in QuArK 6.3 is different from
that of 6.2, some care should be taken with transferring projects.  First,
make sure the project is backed up, then open it in 6.3 and make sure
that the scales look correct, and that it builds correctly.  Then, as
you further edit the map, faces that are operated on will shift their
texture-representation to the new one, so keep an eye on things to make
sure nothing is going wrong.  If problems occur, announce them to the
<a href="http://quark.planetquake.gamespy.com/forums/">QuArK forum</a>, so we can
figure out what has gone wrong.

QuArK 6.2 will not correctly read .qrk's and .qkm's written by QuArK 6.3,
so migration to 6.3 is basically a one-way street (we could probably
come up with a retrogression tool if one was really wanted, but
no guarantees; 6.3 is supposed to be better!)
