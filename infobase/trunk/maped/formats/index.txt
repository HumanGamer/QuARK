title: Supported Map Formats

QuArK writes maps in a considerable range of formats, some aspects of which
are selected in the `Output Map Format' dropdown box in the configuration
section for each game, while others are hard-coded to the specific game
(because they reflect specific features of the engine itself rather than
more mutable properties of the build-tools).

The currently supported main types, choosable in the Output Map Format box,
are:
<UL>
<LI>Classic Quake: the original, with hardcoded variants for Quake1/2/3,
Hexen II, Sin.  Limited in the range of texture positioning and scaling
it can code.
<LI>Quark etp: a variant of Classic Quake in which the texture position and
scaling is given by the face threepoints, with a `TX' code 1 or 2 to indicate
whether the texture should be mirror-imaged or not.  This gives full
flexibility in positioning textures, but <I>may</I> be associated with
some small errors in vertex positioning (it's not certain that this is
really a problem in output maps).
<LI>Valve 220: Valve's enhancement of Classic Quake.
<LI>Brush Primitives: Id's enhancement of Classic Quake, for Q3 and RCTW
(will probably be supported for any games that GtkRadiant comes to support).
</UL>
Quark etp only works with custom build tools that support it (including
Zoner's HL tools).  You shouldn't change the Map Output Format for a game
unless you know what you're doing.

Two other format options you can teak in the Map|Options section of the
config screen are whether or not to write comments, and whether or not
to write floating-point coordinates in the map files; the latter box in
particular should be left alone unless you know what you're doing.
