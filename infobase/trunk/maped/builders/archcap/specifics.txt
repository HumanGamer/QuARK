The RMB menu currently at least offers only two basic
shapes (arch/cap, bevel) in two orientations each, but
the `duplicators' that implement these shapes have a
considerable number of specifics that implement variations.
You can see what these specifics do by making an arch and
experimenting.   If you uncheck the `inverse' specific for
example, the arch will turn into a `cap'.  In general, inverse
shapes have their textures on a concave curve-side, non-inverse
on a convex one.<BR><BR>
Another useful one is `lower'.  This flips the arch upside-down,
so that the curved surface is a U that you can walk over.
Lower arches take their texture from their bottom ('down')
rather than their top ('up') faces.
Another is `stretchtex'.  If this is checked, then whatever
texture on the back face will be stretched to cover the
curve, without any of the alignment manipulations.  This
is useful if you have a specially prepared texture that
you specifically want to put on a curve, but not elsewhere.

Some of the remaining ones will be discussed in the section
