title: Specifics

The RMB menu currently offers three basic
shapes (arch/cap, bevel, column) in two orientations each, but
the 'duplicators' that implement these shapes have a
considerable number of specifics that implement variations.
You can see what these specifics do by making an arch and
experimenting.   If you uncheck the 'inverse' specific for
example, the arch will turn into a 'cap'.  In general, inverse
shapes have their textures on a concave curve-side, non-inverse
on a convex one.

Another useful one is 'lower'.  This flips the arch upside-down,
so that the curved surface is a U that you can walk over.
Lower arches take their texture from their bottom ('down')
rather than their top ('up') faces.  Then there's 'onside',
which lays the arch down its side, to make a curved wall.

Another is 'stretchtex'.  If this is checked, then whatever
texture on the back face will be stretched to cover the
curve, without any of the alignment manipulations.  This
is useful if you have a specially prepared texture that
you specifically want to put on a curve, but not elsewhere.

Some of the remaining ones will be discussed in the section
<ref>maped/builders/archcap/techniques</ref>
 below.
