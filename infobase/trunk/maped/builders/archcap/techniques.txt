<TR><TD COLSPAN=2>I'll discuss two techniques here,
the use of a `thick' arch to avoid texture
misalignments between the front face and the inside edges,
and how to do a round porthole with no texture seam
around the curved opening.
</TD></TR>

Start with something like the uninspiring archway to the
right.  Basically what we're going to do is create
a whole nother arch inside it, with the same dimensions,
but with a `thickness' projecting inward, with a different
texture and a curved `seam' on the front and back.

A way to do this is as follows.  First select the arch's
guide-brush, and then Edit | Duplicate from the top menu.
If you look inside the arch duplicator you'll see that there
are two brushes.  Drag one of them out out from inside the duplicator
so that it is sister the duplicator rather than inside it,
select it, and finally
RMB | Curves | Arch in a map view, looking at it from
the front.  You'll now have two identical arches occupying
the same space.
Now select one of the arches and look at its specifics,
and input a value such as say 8 into its `thick' specific.

<TR><TD>You should now see an extra thickness protruding
inware around the curved surface, onto which you can put
some different texture.  Next you'll want to make two side
brushes with the new texture to put under the overhang, before
doing the textures, the result might look something like
this.
Getting fully aligned textures here is a bit tricky, but here's
a procedure.  Put the texture you want on to top face of the
thick arch's guide brush, tag that face, and then wrap it
down onto the hidden (facing the wall) faces of the two
side brushes.  Then tag this hidden face of one brush, and
project the texture onto its opposite exposed 
face (facing into the archway),
and repeat for the second brush.

This can be tricky and confusing because of all the mirror-image
type reversals from wrapping and projecting textures onto
faces pointing in opposite directions, but it can be made
to work out.  One point to keep in mind is that the texture
you put on the top face of the arch's guide brush is
reflected (mirror-imaged once) when you see it on the
inside surface of the arch; when you wrap it onto the hidden
faces of the side-brushes it doesn't get reflected, only
rotated, but finally gets reflected when you project it from
the hidden face to the exposed one.
(So it's confusing; figuring it out was worse).

Another technique I'll describe verbally without pikkies is
a round porthole.  First make a square opening, fit a
brush into it exactly, wrap a texture seamlessly around
the brush (the faces that contact the opening), and project
the top and bottom textures of the brush onto the
top and bottom faces of the opening.  Then cut the brush in
half so that you have two brushes, one on top of the other,
exactly touching, filling the bottom and top half of the
opening.
Now make each brush into an arch, set the lower one to
lower, and project the top and bottom textures of the
opening to the top and bottom faces of the corresponding
brush.  That should do it.
