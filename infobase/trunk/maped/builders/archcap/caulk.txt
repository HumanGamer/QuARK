title:  Caulking

The arch now looks OK, but we've left out an important step,
caulking.  The problem with it now is that the engine will
actually draw the brush-faces that are concealed by the curves,
which is a waste, because they can't be seen.  The solution
is to attach a the 'special/caulk' shader to the hidden faces.
For the top slab that sits over the arch, we can easily just
do this, but for the sides it's a bit more of a chore, because
part of the inside faces of the walls are exposed, and others
aren't (this is also a 't-junct', which is Evil.<BR><BR>

So there's a little trick to speed up caulking.  Tag say the
left face of the guide-brush of the arch, then select the
right-face of the left wall-block.  Now RMB|More Tagging|Caulk
from tagged.  The wall will be split into two, and the caulk
pasted onto the part of the wall that's hidden.<BR><BR>

In Quark, you can see a bit of the caulk-texture where the curve
and the wall join, but in Quake3a you can't (I'm not sure if
Quark's behavior is a bug or a feature).  Of course, if you
reproportion the arch, you'll need to adjust the walls as well;
a good application for Tag Face/Glue to Tagged.<BR><BR>
