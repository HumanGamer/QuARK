<b>Welcome to QuArK's Information Base</b>

The goal of this database is to give a centralized place which stores all information about QuArK in a coherent way. With time, information found in other places should be moved here.

These pages can also be downloaded for offline viewing. Go to the <link download_help>QuArK's download-page</link> to find the zip-archive.

<!--
Currently, the main source of information for mappers is Decker's <a href="http://www.planetquake.com/quark/help/index.html">Online documentation</a>.
-->
<!--
This database currently focuses on aspects of QuArK less directly interesting to mappers, from advanced mapping questions to plug-ins programming to in-depth information about the QuArK source code.
