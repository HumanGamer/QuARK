<html><strong>Welcome to QuArK's Information Base</strong><br>
The goal of this database is to give a centralized place which stores all
information about QuArK in a coherent way. With time, information found in
other places should be moved here.

Currently, the main source of information for mappers is Decker's
<html><a href="http://www.planetquake.com/quark/help/index.html">Online documentation</a>.

This database currently focuses on aspects of QuArK less
directly interesting to mappers, from advanced mapping questions to plug-ins
programming to in-depth information about the QuArK source code.
