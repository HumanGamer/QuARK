<i>Open</i> works just as in the QuArK-Explorer. You can open any supported model file with
this to work on.

<i>Save</i> will save your current model to the same location and file type it was opened as.

<i>Save in QuArK Explorer</i>. Use this if you want to add this model to your
current project. This way, you can have multiple revisions of a model, in
a single project. Just remember to give them a sensible name, so you can
distinguish them. The model editor will automatically close itself when you use this menuitem.

<i>Save as file</i>. If you want to export this model as a different supported model format type,
select this menuitem.

<i>Save all</i> will save all opened files. This includes the current project
and modified <g>add-on</g> data files.

<i>Close</i> will close the model editor.
