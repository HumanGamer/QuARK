<i>Duplicate Current Frame </i>&nbsp;: This copies a single frame that is currently selected and
adds that copy to that model component's animation frames list.
For multiple frame copies use the 'Duplicate' function on the 'Edit' menu.

<i>Match Frame Count </i>&nbsp;: This will duplicate the number of frames in the selected components
with the one that has the most frames in it. It will not copy the frames, only how many there are.

<i>Check Components </i>&nbsp;: This checks components for any errors in them that might exist.

<i>Auto Assemble </i>&nbsp;: Some models are made up of seperate model files for example .md3 files.
This function attempts to auto-load those related models model files and attach them using what is known
as tags to match them up correctly.

<i>X Y Z Axis locks </i>&nbsp;: All three of these items work in the same manor but are independent from one another.
