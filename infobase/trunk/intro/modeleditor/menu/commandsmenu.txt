<i>Duplicate Current Frame </i>&nbsp;: This copies a single frame that is currently selected and
adds that copy to that model component's animation frames list.
For multiple frame copies use the 'Duplicate' function on the 'Edit' menu.

<i>Add Triangle </i>&nbsp;: This adds a new triangle to the currently selected component. It works
in conjunction with the <b>Pick Vertex</b> function on the
<a href="intro.modeleditor.rmbmenus.html#vertexrmbmenu">Vertex RMB menu</a> described below. See that
function for more details.

<i>Delete Triangle </i>&nbsp;: This removes a triangle from the currently selected component. It works
in conjunction with the <b>Pick Vertex</b> function on the
<a href="intro.modeleditor.rmbmenus.html#vertexrmbmenu">Vertex RMB menu</a> described below. See that
function for more details.

<i>Check Components </i>&nbsp;: This checks components for any errors in them that might exist.

<i>Auto Assemble </i>&nbsp;: Some models are made up of seperate model files for example .md3 files.
This function attempts to auto-load those related models model files and attach them using what is known
as tags to match them up correctly.

<i>X Y Z Axis locks </i>&nbsp;: All three of these items work in the same manor but are independent from one another.
They restrict any <g>vertex</g> movement in their related direction for all views and are interactive with their
corrisponding buttons on the
<a href="intro.modeleditor.toolpalettes.viewselection.html">View Selection tool-palette</a>.

All of these commands are dupelicated as a sub-menu of the
<a href="intro.modeleditor.rmbmenus.html#viewsrmbmenus">Editor Views RMB menus</a>.
