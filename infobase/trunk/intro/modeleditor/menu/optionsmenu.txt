<i><b>Grid scale in 2D views</b> </i>&nbsp;: These functions allow you to display a scale and tick mark guides
of the current grid setting in any one, combination, or all of the 2D views of the Editor, as
shown in the top sub-menu. You can also center any one or combination of the scales for
each view. If ' All 2D views '  or ' all scales centered '  is checked, it will deactivate this
menu's individual items.

<i><b>Ruler guide in 2D views</b> </i>&nbsp;: These functions allow you to display a line with the unit distance
of total selected items in any one, combination, or all of the 2D views of the Editor. Much like
the&nbsp;'Grid scale in 2D views'&nbsp; function above, this feature also has its own list of selections,
as shown in the far right sub-menu. If one of these sub-menu items is active, checked, then when ever a single
<g>face</g>, <g>object</g> or <g>component</g> is selected a&nbsp;'Ruler'&nbsp; will be displayed above and/or
beside them from the starting point to the end point of the selected items along with&nbsp;'0'&nbsp; at the
starting point and the total amount of their distance at the end point.

<i><b>3D Rotation Options</b> - submenu items </i>&nbsp;:<br>
<i>Original 3Dview rotation </i>&nbsp;: This is the way QuArK's model rotation has worked in the past.
As long as the model drag is started flat (z at 0) it rotates and tilts during rotation fine.
But if it does a hiccup during the drag with the model tilted that is when it starts to drift
off center and possibly out of the view eventually. The model can be placed anywhere in the view and
rotated from that location.

<i>Lock to center of 3Dview </i>&nbsp;: This method 'locks' the center of the grid to the center of the 3D view
and rotates from the 0,0,0, point of the grid, its center. If the grid is off to another location of
the view it will 'snap' back to the views center. The cursor location does not matter for dragging,
the grid will remain in the views center. This makes the rotation very consistent.
You can rotate and zoom in for close detail work on the model. But if you start another rotation
it will jump back to the grids center and probably throw your up close position off.

<i>Lock to center of model </i>&nbsp;: This function 'locks' the center of the model to the center of the view.
It functions just like the 'Lock to center of 3Dview' method above
based on the center of the model. However, because not all models are created at the center of their grid
the method above could cause it to be near the edge of the view or completely out of view.
This option compensates for that and will put the model in the proper center location of the view.
The same situation will exist for up close detail work if a new rotation is started.

<i>Rotate at start position </i>&nbsp;: This function is designed to give far more rotation consistency based on
where the cursor is at the time it is clicked to start a rotation at some place on the model.
It will then re-center that position to the center of the view to start rotating from.
Unlike the 'Original 3Dview rotation' method, this would allow close up detail rotation without
the model jumping back to some other location as in all of the above cases.

<i><b>Draw handles while rotating</b> </i>&nbsp;: This allows the models vertex handles (if active) to be drawn during
rotation, but this will slow down the redrawing process and can make rotation seem jerky.

<i><b>Model Axis in views</b> </i>&nbsp;: This displays the models axis on which it was built in all views,
showing its X, Y and Z direction. The size of its letter indicators and line thickness can be increased or
decreased by using the '<g>Set Line Thickness</g>' function, a little further down. Their individual colors can
be changedin the <a href="intro.modeleditor.toolpalettes.viewselection.html#coloroptions">Colors Options</a> settings.

<i><b>Draw back faces</b> </i>&nbsp;: This allows the back face checkerboard pattern to be drawn in all view modes when the
<g>'Views Options', 'Mesh in Frames'</g> of the <a href="intro.modeleditor.toolpalettes.viewselection.html#viewoptions">Views Options</a>
is checked for that view. Using the option in this manner will help to distinguish which direction the faces are facing for proper construction.

<i><b>Set Line Thickness</b> </i>&nbsp;: This lets you set the thickness of certain lines that are drawn on the Editor's views,
such as the outlining of selected model mesh faces and the models axis lines.

<i><b>Editor Face Selection Options</b> - submenu items </i>&nbsp;:<br>

<i>Draw Ticks During Drag </i>&nbsp;: These functions give various methods for drawing the Models Skin Mesh Vertex Ticks while doing a drag.<br>
The 1st &nbsp;<g><u>Rectangle drag-method 1</u> &nbsp;</g>: This function will draw the Skin-view mesh vertex 'Ticks' during a rectangle drag with<br>
a minimum amount of flickering, but is a slower drawing method.<br>
The 2nd <g><u>Rectangle drag-method 2</u> &nbsp;</g>: This function will draw the Skin-view mesh vertex 'Ticks', using the fastest method,<br>
during a rectangle drag, but will cause the greatest amount of flickering.

<i><b>Paste objects at screen center</b> </i>&nbsp;: Check this if you want objects that you

<i><b>Enlarge Vertices Ticks</b> </i>&nbsp;: This makes the model's ticks 1 size larger for easer viewing.

<i><b>Rebuild 3D views</b> </i>&nbsp;: This rebuilds the 3D views (actually all views) in the Model Editor
