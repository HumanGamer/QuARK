title: Selection & Navigation Methods
author: cdunde

<i><b><u>Selection Methods </u></b></i>: Two different selection methods have been designed into the
QuArK Model Editor for the <a href="intro.modeleditor.skinview.html">Skin-view page</a>. Also see the
Model Editor's <a href="intro.modeleditor.overview.html">Overview</a> page
<a href="intro.modeleditor.overview.html#selection">Selection & Navigation Methods</a> for the editor's particular methods.

<i><g>LMB</g> Vertex Handle Drag</i> : This method is available when your cursor is directly over a model
components <g>Skin</g> mesh <g>vertex</g> (point) <g>drag handle</g> and the cursor will change in appearance when it is.
Holding down your <g>LMB</g> will allow you to <g>drag</g> that particular vertex to a new location in the view,
changing the appearance of the model for that particular <g>component</g>. A specific <g>animation frame</g>
<b>does not</b> need to be selected for this function to work.

<i><g>LMB</g> Rectangle Selector</i> : This method is available when the cursor is <b>not</b> over a <g>vertex</g>.
Holding down your <g>LMB</g> and moving your mouse will produce a <g>Red Rectangle</g> selector that you can
drag across the Skin-view. This selector will allow you to make a multiple selection of a model components <g>Skin</g> mesh
vertex points at one time. These vertexes can then be passed on to the
<a href="intro.modeleditor.model.html#components">Editor views</a> or will be done so
automatically if you have activated one of the options on the Skin-view
<a href="intro.modeleditor.skinview.html#funcsnmenus">RMB menu</a>
(which you can obtain by clicking your <g>RMB</g> in the Skin-view) or the main
<a href="intro.modeleditor.menu.html#optionsmenu">Options menu</a>
for <a href="intro.modeleditor.skinview.html#funcsnmenus">Skin-view Options</a>.
As the Model Editor is developed, this selection method will be used to move and edit whole sections of the model's <g>Skin</g>
mesh by use of its selected <g>vertexes</g>.
To <g>de-select</g> any and all vertexes, simply do another small <g>Rectangle drag</g> in any unused area of the Skin-view.

<i><g>LMB</g> & <g>RMB</g> Selector</i> : (not activated at this time, reserved for future use and functions.)

<b><u>Skin-view's button section</u></b>

<i><u>Skin-view Grid button </u></i>: (far left button) Because the Model Editor and the Skin-view work on different aspects of
a model, they require their own distinct and independent <g>Grids</g>, which is the first button to the far left.
Each have their own <g>grid menu</g> with pre-set amounts, but any amount can be entered by clicking on the <g>Other</g>
item shown at the very bottom of the menu. In addition, for the Skin-view, there are two
<a href="intro.modeleditor.skinview.html#funcsnmenus">RMB menu</a> items for the <g> Skin-view grid</g> (see below).

<i><u>Skin-view Zoom button </u></i>: (2nd button) This allows you to zoom in and out from the skin with some pre-set factors
as well as a setting for a 'custom' zoom amount. It only applies to the Skin-view and not to any other view
of the Model Editor.

<i><u>Vertex drag mode </u></i>: (3rd button) This is a special feature of the Skin-view. It allows you to choose to make
either a <b>multiple drag</b> (the default setting) using a single drag handle, meaning all other handles in the same location will be
dragged also automatically keeping the <g>skin mesh</g> together, or a <b>single drag</b> only dragging the
handle on top which will pull the <g>skin mesh</g> apart for individual placement. This button also works
in conjunction with the <g>RMB</g> menus that we will cover further on.

<i><u>Remap Snapshot button </u></i>: (far right button) Pressing this icon, will reset the selected component's <g>skin mesh</g> using
the angle of view that is seen in the editor's 3D view when the button is clicked. Doing it this way allows you to re-map any selected
faces, of any component, at any angle or direction for complete control of that process. So if you originally skin from the side and the
top faces are distorted, you can select those faces, rotate the editor's 3D view to look from the top and click this button to re-skin them.
There is also an option on the Skin-view <g>RMB</g> menu, shown below, to turn off the 3D view and re-skin from the Skin-view 2D perspective instead.
If the outcome does not go as planed, just use the <g>RMB</g> menu or editor's <a href="intro.modeleditor.menu.html#editmenu">undo function</a>
to reverse the action.

A couple of other issues about all of the selection methods described at the beginning:

1) Once a selection is made the Skin-view <a href="intro.modeleditor.skinview.html#funcsnmenus">RMB menu, 'Vertex Commands'</a>
will become active for its items use.

2) How and what a selection will select is also linked to the
<a href="intro.modeleditor.skinview.html#funcsnmenus">Vertex drag mode</a> button above the actual viewing area.
Meaning, either single depth or full depth selection of the vertexes can be made depending on the mode that button
is set to at the time. Once a selection has been made,
the <a href="intro.modeleditor.skinview.html#funcsnmenus">Vertex drag mode</a> can be changed to work with your
selection in various different ways. A little experimentation will assist you in learning these differences.

<i><b><u>Navigation Methods </u></b></i>: The <a href="intro.modeleditor.skinview.html">Skin-view</a> navigates
much like it does in the rest of the Model Editor,
<a href="intro.modeleditor.model.html#components">2D views</a> and is covered in detail below.

<i>Skin-view viewing area</i> : Using your <g>MMB</g> you can <g>Zoom</g> in and out for the 2D viewing area.
Press and holding your <g>RMB</g> will allow you to <g>Scroll</g> or <g>Pan</g> in that same view.
All other combinations are used as described above in the
<a href="intro.modeleditor.skinview.html#selection">Selection Methods</a> section.
