Picking up from where we left off from above, these are the <g>RMB</g> menus available in the
Skin-view that can assist you in multi and single vertex movement and <g>realignment</g>.
All of these functions work in conjunction with the <g>Vertex drag mode</g> button which is
shown set to the <g>Single drag mode</g> in the screen shot to the right.

Basically, these functions all center around <g>snapping</g> one or more <g>Picked</g> vertexes,
shown here as blue handles, to a <g>Base</g> location, shown to the right as lime green.
These colors are changeable by selection from the
<a href="intro.modeleditor.toolpalettes.viewselection.html#coloroptions">Model Editors Colors Configuration</a>
section. The <g>Base Vertex</g> uses the same color setting as the <g>Selected brushes, side view</g>
and the <g>Skin Vertexes</g> use the same color as the <g>3D views drag lines</g> setting.

The procedure is simple, first select a <g>Base Vertex</g> by placing your cursor over the one
you wish to choose, then <g>RMB</g> click and select <g>Pick Base Vertex</g> (not shown here but it's
at the top off the menu where it displays <g>Change Base Vertex</g> now).

Second, do the same for each skin vertex choosing the <g>Pick Skin Vertex</g> menu item each time.

Finally, when you are ready to make your <g>snap</g> either place your cursor over any of the selected
skin vertexes or anywhere in the Skin-view, <g>RMB</g> click and select <g>Align skin vertexes</g>.

The snap will take place and the final results will look something like the second image of the eye
at the bottom of the screen shot. Now a couple of special situations in using these menu functions.

If you are only going to snap one <g>Skin Vertex</g> to the <g>Base Vertex</g> then all you need to do
is select that <g>Base Vertex</g> and the <g>Align skin vertexes</g> menu items following the steps above.
You do not need to use the <g>Pick Skin Vertex</g> menu item. In addition, the <g>Base Vertex</g> will
remain selected for you, so you can simply <g>RMB</g> click over another skin vertex to move it to the
same position <b>or</b> you can place your cursor over any unselected vertex and choose the
<g>Change Base Vertex</g> menu item and it will jump to that new location and you can carry on from there.

Using these along with the <g>Vertex drag mode</g> button a number of various combinations of aligning
vertexes can be accomplished. And as stated in the section above, the exact co-ordnances will be displayed
of all of these items will be shown in the editor's Help box as you proceed through the phases of your editing.
