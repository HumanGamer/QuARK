Creates a new BBox sub-group in the tree-view 'Misc' folder,
where you can place bbox (poly bounding and collision) objects in.
If any existing bboxes are selected when this button is clicked
it will place all of those into the new sub-group for you.

Once you have created a sub-group, select it in the tree-view
and press <b>F2</b> to rename it.
