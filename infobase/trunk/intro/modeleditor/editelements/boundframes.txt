title: Bound Frames
author: cdunde

<g>Bound frames</g> are fairly simple and straight forward. They are a box area that surrounds the entire model
for each animation frame of that model.

This is done by giving just two vectors, each consisting of three values representing an x,y,z point
in 3D space. One vector gives the minimum point and the other the maximum point.
Using these two vectors a 3D box can be created that encloses the model for that frame.

The existence of <g>bound frames</g> can be use for determining the collision area of a model.
Some games may use it for that purpose, but most games probably do not.

Because this is a very minor application, that can easily be calculated when a model is exported to its
format file, the creation of bound frames for viewing in the editor will most likely not be supported.
But we felt this description of what they are should at least be added to the InfoBase docs.
