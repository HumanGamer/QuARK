<g>Bound frames</g> are like <a href="intro.modeleditor.editelements.html#boundingboxes">Bounding Boxes</a>
but is an old QuArK system that is not really used any more. We only mention it here because sometimes
you may see them when you open a Quake 3 .md3 model directly using QuArK. There is now a Model Importer
that handles those much better.
