title: Tags System
author: cdunde

In the editor, these are displayed as dark purple dots, or bright red if they are selected.
One or more can be selected at the same time. <g>RMB</g> click over one to get its popup menu.

To add a new tag, select one component in the tree-view, do a <g>RMB</g> click in one of the
editor's 2D views to get a popup menu and select <g>Tag Commands > Add Tag Here</g>.
You can then rename the tag in the tree-view.

To delete a tag, do a <g>RMB</g> click over the tag in the tree-view or one of the editor's views
to get its popup menu and select <g>Delete this tag</g>. do <b>NOT</b> use any other Delete menu item
as they will not properly remove the tag and all its hidden data, causing problems.

<g>Tags</g> are primarily used for <g>Quake 3</g> model files ( <g>.md3</g> ).
Their purpose is to link one <g>.md3</g> model section to another <g>.md3</g> model section.
When all these sections have been imported to the editor, in their proper order, they can
then be put together by the use of their <g>tags</g> to create a single complete model.

The process of putting these pieces together is done automatically by the <g>plugins\ie_md3_import.py</g>
file when the final <g>.md3</g> file is imported. For the most part, <g>tags</g> are used for the
games <g>player</g> models that each person uses to represent them selves in the game.
They are also used in the player's <g>weapon</g> <g>.md3</g> models to attach the weapon to that model
and any additional parts to the <g>weapon</g>.

Each <g>player</g> model consist of three parts or <g>.md3</g> models. The <g>head.md3</g>,
the <g>lower.md3</g> and the <g>upper.md3</g> in that order. All three are kept in a single folder
with the name of that <g>player</g> model. The folder also contains other files pertaining to that
specific model. They are:
<ul>
<li> Other head, lower and upper <g>lower poly</g> versions of the model.
<li> Skin texture ( <g>.tga</g> ) image files.
<li> Skin definition ( <g>.skin</g> ) text files.
<li> Animation ( <g>.cfg</g> ) configuration text files.
</ul>
The last of these, the <g>animation.cfg</g> file, breaks down the models animation frames
into animation sequences that are used in the game when the player does different movements
or certain actions take place...like being killed.

The <g>animation.cfg</g> files are text files that can be edited, changed, in the
<a href="intro.modeleditor.html">QuArK Model Editor</a> and, once saved, those animation sequence
changes can immediately be viewed in the editor. This is covered in more detail in the
<a href="#animationCFG">Animation CFG</a> section below. But first, a few more things about <g>tags</g>
need to be covered.

Think of a <g>tag</g> as a folder. In each tag are its <g>tag frames</g> which correspond with the
model's animation frames, one <g>tagframe</g> each.

A <g>tagframe</g> contains two pieces of data, its <g>rotation matrix</g> and its <g>origin</g>
or x,y,z position in 3D space which you will see in its
<a href="intro.modeleditor.dataforms.html#specsargsview">Specifics/Args-view</a>. The position of the
<g>Tag</g> can be changed by changing the three values shown there. It will also change all the other
<g>tagframes</g> of that <g>tag</g> automatically by the same <g>movement amount</g>, because these
must remain consistent or the model would come apart.

Tags can also be changed by placing your mouse cursor over one, holding down on your <g>LMB</g> and
dragging the tag to its new position in any of the editor's views, updating its <g>origin</g>
that you see in its <a href="intro.modeleditor.dataforms.html#specsargsview">Specifics/Args-view</a>.

<a name="animationCFG"></a>
<g><i><b><u>Animation CFG :</u></b></i></g><br>
Like the <g>.md3</g> files, tags have specific parts and specific names, they are:
<img border=1 align=right>tags1.png</img>
<ul>
<li> tag_head
<li> tag_weapon
<li> tag_torso
</ul>
They should be maintained in that order as well to avoid problems in the editor.<br>
You will notice in the editor's <a href="intro.modeleditor.dataforms.html#treeview">tree-view</a>
that the model's folder name is added in front of each of its tag names, as shown at the top
of its <a href="intro.modeleditor.dataforms.html#specsargsview">Specifics/Args-view</a> to the right
for the <g>tag_torso</g>. This keeps the tags of one model from being overwritten by another model.
Doing it this way allows you to import more then one <g>.md3</g> model into the editor, if so desired.

<b>Tags</b><br>
Below the tag's <g>classname</g> you will see two dropdown lists. By clicking their arrows they
will display all the tags and components that belong to that model.

By clicking on one of those names in the list, it will jump you to that tag or component and select it.

<b>AnimationCFG File</b><br>
In this section you find four items dealing with the animation cfg file directly for editing, changing, it.
<ul>
<li> cfg file - gives the full path to and name of that file.
<li> cfg lines - the number of lines to display in the edit section below, click the arrows to change it.
<li> edit cfg - opens the file in an external text editor for making changes.
<li> cfg text - displays the current text of that file. If changed, this will also change.
</ul>
To <g>edit</g> the cfg file click the gray <g>edit cfg</g> button to open the file in your external
text editor. Make your changes and <b>be sure</b> to click <b>Save</b> in that editor <b>before</b>
closing it or the external editor message that QuArK will display. Other wise it will not update correctly.

To save a hard copy of the cfg file click <b>Save As</b> in your external editor, name it <b>animation.cfg</b>
and select a place to save it at. Later you can move that new file to the model's folder <b>BUT</b>
be sure not to overwrite your original file with that same name.

<b>Play list upper/lower</b><br>
The next two sections deal with the <g>animation sequences</g> that the cfg file controls.<br>
The <g>upper</g> section takes priority over the <g>lower</g> section. Meaning, if the name
of the sequence starts with <g>BOTH_</g> it will not let the sequence in the <g>lower</g> section
to animate. Click the arrows to the right to select other sequences, even while
<a href="intro.modeleditor.toolpalettes.animation.html">running animation</a>.
<ul>
<li> first frame - of the cfg file, these are not the same numbers as shown in the editor's 
<a href="intro.modeleditor.dataforms.html#treeview">tree-view</a>
<li> num frame - the number of frames it will play, animate, for that sequence.
<li> looping frames - the number of frames it will continue to play, loop over, again and again.
<li> CFG FPS - the frames per second speed to play that sequence at in the game.
</ul>
