This is a special section that covers the Model Editor's model formats
that can be exported, how they need to be setup, what needs to be included 
and the steps to do so.

Various ones use different methods such as
<a href="intro.modeleditor.editelements.html#tags">tags</a> (or attachments),
<a href="intro.modeleditor.editelements.html#bones">bones</a>,
<a href="intro.modeleditor.vertexcolorandweights.html#vertexweights">Vertex Weights</a> and
<a href="intro.modeleditor.vertexcolorandweights.html#vertexcoloring">UV Vertex Colors</a>
for static (non-animated) and animated models. Even though QuArK supports these
methods the actual exporter for another type of format will not include them if
that particular format does not use them. Models that do not have them will
need to be edited so they do if the exporter format requires them.

In addition, some model formats have their own
<a href="intro.modeleditor.dataforms.html#specsargsview">Specifics/Args</a>
page to assist in setting these methods and if one does not exist
then a defaults page is provided.

This way QuArK not only edits models, it will actually allow the conversion
of one model format into another making them usable in different games.
In addition, some games use the same format as others and those have been noted
by their abbreviated initials. A few are identified as follows:<br>
<a href="intro.configuration.games.specificgames.html">EF2 </a>&nbsp;: Elite Force 2<br>
<a href="intro.configuration.games.specificgames.html">FAKK2 </a>&nbsp;: Heavy Metal FAKK2 (Federation Assigned Ketogenic Killzone to the 2nd level)<br>
<a href="intro.configuration.games.specificgames.rtcw.html">RTCW </a>&nbsp;: Return to Castle Wolfenstein<br>
<a href="intro.configuration.games.specificgames.rtcw-et.html">RTCW-ET </a>&nbsp;: Wolfenstein - Enemy Territory<br>
<a href="intro.configuration.games.specificgames.html">SoF2 </a>&nbsp;: Solder of Fortune 2<br>
<a href="intro.configuration.games.specificgames.stvef.html">STVEF </a>&nbsp;: Star Trek Voyager Elite Force

As new formats are added, details relating to them specifically can be added
here to assist those that will be using them for exportation to their original
format or to an entirely different format.
