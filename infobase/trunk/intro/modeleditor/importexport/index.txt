The <a href="intro.modeleditor.model.html">QuArK's Model Structure</a> section covers more of the
technical part, in detail, of QuArK's Model Structure for programming purposes and is very important to
understand if you plan to do any code writing for the Model Editor.

This section is dedicated to the structure of a <g>QuArK Internal Object</g> that makes up a
<g>model component</g> and how to create it when writing a Model Importer and Exporter plugins file.
Occasionally references will be made to the Model Editor's Python code located in the quarkpy and
plugins folders as well as areas in the <ref>src/quarkx</ref> section of these Infobase docs.

It is highly recommended that you at least read the
<a href="intro.modeleditor.model.html#components">Components of a Model</a> section before going on with
this section to get a good understanding and visualization of a <g>model component's</g> structure since
that is what an importer will be creating and an exporter will be writing the model file from.

Although highly technical in understanding a components structure and Python coding, writing a QuArK Model
Importer and Exporter is truly a rewarding learning experience. These sections are designed to help you
gain that experience with a little effort, time and perseverance. We look forward to
seeing your results.
