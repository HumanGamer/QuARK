title: Adding Bones & Their Structure

Some models have their own bone structure built into them for animation purposes.
So those need to be imported\exported along with the other data.<br>
This section covers how QuArK needs the data to work with its bone system.
It would be a good idea to read about the <a href="intro.modeleditor.editelements.html#bones">Bones System<a>
to get an understanding of how it works<br>
and its capabilities.

<a name="bones1"></a>
<g><i><b><u>What's in a Bone</u></b></i></g>&nbsp;:<br>

Basically the bone data is split up into two areas, that which is
<a href="intro.modeleditor.importexport.html#componentcreation">kept within the bone</a> object itself
<a href="intro.modeleditor.importexport.html#componentcreation">when it is created</a>
and that which is created by QuArK when the model is read into<br>
the editor and kept in a <g>Python Dictionary List</g> named <a href="#bones2">ModelComponentList</a>.

The data that is <a href="#bones1">kept within the bone</a> primarily is what is displayed on a bones
<a href="intro.modeleditor.dataforms.html#specsargsview">Specifics/Args page</a>, shown to the right here,
although it is also used throughout QuArK's internal code.

This data must be read in from the imported model file and added for each component
<a href="intro.modeleditor.importexport.html#componentcreation">when it is created</a> in
the Python import file <a href="intro.modeleditor.importexport.html#componentcreation">shown futher above</a>.<br>
If a model consist of multiple parts, or components, then the bones need to be created and added when each
component is. This is because each bone has two handles,<br>
a start and end handle, which can be assigned to different components by that components name.<br>
In addition, each bone must have its own individual name to avoid errors from occurring in the editor.

<u><i>Data within the Bone </i></u>&nbsp;:

Data that must be added for a models imported bones consist of two groups,
<a href="#baseitems">Base Items</a> and <a href="#otheritems">Other Items</a>.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a name="baseitems"><g><i>Base Items </i></g></a>&nbsp;:
The minimum items to construct a bone are shown below and are stored in a <g>Python Dictionary List</g>.<br>
With this type of list, the order of their arrangement does not matter because their <g>keys</g>
names, such as <g>start_component</g>, are used to retrieve the data as it is needed.

Because the values are read in from the model file being imported we can not give code here that you can just copy and paste But you should be able to get enough from the<br>
following example to write your own code. Also you can see more by opening the <g>QuArK\quarkpy\mdlutils.py</g> file, use any text editor like <g>WordPad</g> and do a word search for<br>
<g>def addbone(</g>. You will also find many other functions there in the <g># Skeleton & Bone functions</g> area.
<code>
    new_o_bone = quarkx.newobj(bonename + ":bone") # Each bone must be created as a new object.
    new_o_bone['start_component'] = component.name # The component name that this handle is assigned to.
    new_o_bone['start_point'] = (-23.702332855224609, -4.4704371452331543, 2.0622565078735352) # As a tuple as shown for x,y,z.

    new_o_bone['start_color'] = new_o_bone['end_color'] = MapColor("BoneHandles", SS_MODEL) # Default QuArK function call.
    new_o_bone['end_color'] = str(\x80\x00\x80) # Or a Hex value converted to a string.

    start_vtxlist = ''
    for vtx in list: # "list" being what you have read in from the model file, each item in the list must be an integer.

    new_o_bone['end_vertex_count'] = "0" # Or if no vertexes are assigned to the end handle, same for the start key name.

    skeletongroup.appenditem(new_o_bone) # Each bone must be appended (added) to the skeletongroup here.
</code>
If the end handle of a bone has vertexes assigned to it then that is handled a little differently.
For another very good detailed example of that and the code above look in the<br>
<g>QuArK\quarkpy\mdlentities.py</g> file and word search for &nbsp;<g>class BoneType(</g>
&nbsp;&nbsp;then look at the <g>def handlesopt</g> function there.

Once again, the bone creation code must be added to the import python file further above
<a href="intro.modeleditor.importexport.html#componentcreation">where each component is created</a>.

<a name="bones2"></a>
<u><i>QuArK's ModelComponentList </i></u>&nbsp;:

If you open the <g>QuArK\quarkpy\mdleditor.py</g> file, use any text editor like <g>WordPad</g> and do a word
search for<br>
<g>### Start of bone data creation.</g> you will see how this code is written.
It stops at <g>### End of bone data creation.</g><br>
This data is stored in a list named <g>ModelComponentList</g> as part of the editor and can therefore be called
easily by simply using <g>editor.ModelComponentList</g>.<br>
Doing a word search of its name in this same file near the very top, you will see a description of what kind of
data is stored in it and its structure, which is in a <g>Python Dictionary List</g> format.

Normally this is done by QuArK automatically when opening a <g>.qkl</g> QuArK Model work file that has bones.
However, because a model importer is not the same as opening a model<br>
directly using <a href="intro.modeleditor.menu.html#filemenu">QuArK's File menu Open...</a> function,
this code needs to be copied from below and pasted right after the code for the
<a href="intro.modeleditor.importexport.html#undo1">undo function</a> in the Python import file
<a href="intro.modeleditor.importexport.html#undo1">above</a>.<br>
This will add them to the list, which may contain others, as each component is imported, keeping them separated
by the <g>Component.name</g> which is being used as a <g>Key</g> in this<br>
<g>Python Dictionary List</g>.

As you can see, each component has its own section and within it there are other <g>Python Dictionary Lists</g>, which are <g>'boneobjlist'</g> and<br>
<g>'bonevtxlist'</g>, each of which have other <g>Python Dictionary Lists</g>. Doing it this way accomplishes two things:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1) New data and list can be created for future development easily and consistently,
giving far more flexibility.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2) Not everything can be stored with the bone as we would like, the <b>Delphi code</b>
is not setup to allow it.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<g><i>boneobjlist </i></g>&nbsp;:
<ul>
<li> Each bone has its own sub-dictionary list using its full name as the key.
<li> <b>'s_or_e0'</b> stores data for that bones start handle and <b>'s_or_e1'</b> for the end handle, which again are dictionary list.
<li> <b>'vtxlist'</b> stores a number of small <b>tuple</b> list, of vertex indexes assigned to that handle, within another list, which is used<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to create the <b>'tristodrawlist'</b> below.
<li> <b>'selvtxlist'</b> also stores the vertex indexes assigned to that handle, but in a different way and is used with the <b>'tristodrawlist'</b>
below to help avoid duplicate drawing of triangle drag lines to<br>
increase the programs speed.
<li> <b>'tristodrawlist'</b> stores various lists for any triangle that the assigned vertexes are used in to draw their
drag lines when needed.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each sub-list contains:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the vertex index, triangle index, that vertex's position of that triangle
(point 0, 1 or 2)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and another list of all the vertex indexes that
make up that triangle along with their <b>U, V</b> texture positions.
</ul>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<g><i>bonevtxlist </i></g>&nbsp;:
<ul>
<li> Another dictionary list, uses the vertex index (as a string) for each key which in turn stores...
<li> the <b>'color'</b> of the handle it is assigned to, in Hex format,
<li> the <b>'s_or_e'</b> value of 0 or 1, indicating which bone handle it is assigned to and
<li> the <b>'bonename'</b> that the vertex is assigned to.<br>
The above data is used to quickly get the correct bone handle color to draw each vertex in
and when reassigning or releasing vertexes.
