When this button is active, it allows the <g>LMB</g> drag creation of a bounding box in any 2D view.
Normally it would be used when a single bone is selected for the bbox to be linked to.
However, they can also be used with models that may or may not have bones for different
elements that a particular model format specifies.

Bboxes are <g>polyhedrons</g> just like in the map editor. Bbox stands for bounding box which can also be used for a collision box depending on the model format's needs.
If a bbox is associated with a bone then its name should match that bone's name, for example
<img border=1 align=right valign=top>bboxmaker1.png</img>
<code>upperleg:bone -> upperleg:p</code>

They can be placed in the <a href="intro.modeleditor.dataforms.html#treeview">tree-view</a> individually or in a
<a href="intro.modeleditor.misctools.html">BboxGroupFolder:bbg</a>,
which is usually done to keep them identified with one particular imported model.

The technical part of how they are handled in the editor is covered in the section entitled
<a href="intro.modeleditor.importexport.html#bones">Adding Bones & Their Structure</a>.
Look under its sub-section for
