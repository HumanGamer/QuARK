This does the same function as the <ref> ./extrudeselectedfaces </ref> but leaves <g>bulkheads</g>
between each extrusion drag.

This function only works with selected faces in the Editor's views and the
<a href="intro.modeleditor.toolpalettes.display.html#linear">Linear Drag Handles</a> button active.

Once selected click this button to extrude those faces in any of the editor's views,
but the best control is done in one of its <g>2D views</g>.

Each time a new drag is made a new set of faces will be created from that starting position
to the position at the end of the drag with the new faces selected.

Switching from view to view between drags will change the extruded drag direction.
