This button is always active in one way or another. If <g>deactivated</g> (off, default) your in <g>Vertex mode</g>,
if <g>activated</g> (on) your in <g>Face mode</g>. It performs various ways in each mode in the Model Editor,
depending on what is selected, and has no effect for the <g>Skin-view</g>. When more then one item is selected in
any view it will display a <g>Linear Drag Handle</g>, a circle around those selected objects, for editing purposes.

This circle and its attached handles let you apply <g>linear movement</g> to the objects.
<g>Linear movement</g> means any transformation such as group movement, rotation, enlarging/shrinking and distortion/shearing.
When you use the rotate, enlarge, shrink, and symmetry buttons of the <g>Movement Tool Palette</g>,
you actually apply a linear movement on the selected objects.

Some Toolbar functions require you to be in the Face mode to operate such as <g>Reverse face direction</g>, <g>Subdivide faces</g>,
<g>Face Cut tool</g> and the <g>Keep Dupe Vertexes</g> buttons.

In the main editor when any <g>faces</g> have been selected, clicking on the <g>Vertex/Face modes</g>
button will activate its handles for those faces only, turning off the individual vertex handles
and the Linear Handle for any selected group of them. Clicking the button off will
reactive the handles back to the selected vertex group and turn all of the individual vertex handles back on.
Unselected vertex handles can still be dragged for editing without disturbing the linear group selection
or they can be <g>picked</g> using the <g>RMB</g> menu, when your cursor is over a vertex handle, to add or remove
from the selected linear group of vertex handles.

At any time if you wish to <g>cancel</g> a move you are performing, simply hold down your <g>LMB</g>
and <g>RMB</g> together and continue to do a very slight drag, then let go of both buttons together.

These Linear Drag Handles are the main source of larger group productive editing movements and
manipulative functions. Holding the mouse-cursor steady for a moment on one of the many small
handles in the circle, will bring up a little 'flyover' help.
