IPF or interpolation frames is the setting as to how many added computed position frames will be added
to the selected model component animation to be drawn in the selected view(s) of the editor.

You can select a menu fps speed or use the arrows to the right to increase or decrease
that number while the frames are being animated.

Or click on <g>Other...</g> to get the <g>Custom IPF</g> dialog box to pop-up
to set your own amout.
