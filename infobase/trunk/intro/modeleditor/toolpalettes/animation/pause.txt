Click this button to temporarily pause the chosen animation sequence on the particular frame
that was drawn when this button was clicked.<br>
Click this button again to continue on with the animation from that frame.

If another frame of the chosen sequence is selected during the pause, it will continue
from that point.<br>
The entire frame sequence selection can also be changed during a pause.<br>
Any single frame of that component can be viewed by clicking on it during a pause without loosing
the chosen sequence of frames to animate.<br>
If a component has more then one skin, the skin can also be changed during the pause.
