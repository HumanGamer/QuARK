<i>Undo </i>&nbsp;: This will display the last Undo\Redo action item that has taken place if any.

<i>Paste here </i>&nbsp;: This is a simple paste command to drop something you have copied into
one of the editors views if it can be.

<i>Face Commands </i>&nbsp;: This is the link to the Face Commands sub-menu that will appear
when your courser is over it. To implement this menu you must have the
<a href="intro.modeleditor.toolpalettes.display.html">Linear Drag Handles</a> button
activated (in face mode) and select at least one face in a model component, then this menu
item will appear. These are strictly face (triangle) related and are covered in detail below.

<i>Vertex Commands </i>&nbsp;: This is the link to the Vertex Commands sub-menu that will appear
when your courser is over it. These are strictly vertex related and are covered in detail below.

<i>Commands </i>&nbsp;: This is the link to the Commands sub-menu that will appear
when your courser is over it. These are the same commands located on the 'Commands' menu of the Main
menu bar and are more Triangle related. These are also covered in detail below.

<i>Editor Face Options </i>&nbsp;: These functions deal with the Model Mesh selection methods
available and various visual tools to work with. They are strictly face related and are covered in detail below.

<i>Editor Vertex Options </i>&nbsp;: These functions deal with the Model Mesh selection methods
available and various visual tools to work with. They are strictly vertex related and are covered in detail below.

<i>Reset 3D view </i>&nbsp;: If the model becomes 'lost', goes out of the 3D view, you can use this
function to reset the 3D view and bring the model back to its starting position when it was first opened
and based on the 'Rotation Method' you last chose to rotate the model by.

<u>Each view can be set to one of three rendering modes :</u>

<i>Wireframe </i>&nbsp;: The model mesh will be drawn as lines.
This is the fastest drawing-method of the model-views. 

<i>Solid </i>&nbsp;: Each model is drawn in a single, solid color or shades of that color.
This means that you won't be able to 'see-through' the model once it is in view.

<i>Textured </i>&nbsp;: The model is displayed with its full texture applied for the finished "skinned" look.

<i>Background image... </i>&nbsp;: When selected, this will open a dialog box where you can choose a .bmp image
file to place and display in the 2D view that the cursor was in when the RMB was clicked.

<i>Duplicate Current Frame </i>&nbsp;: This copies a single frame that is currently selected and
adds that copy to that model component's animation frames list.
For multiple frame copies use the 'Duplicate' function on the 'Edit' menu.

<i>Add Triangle </i>&nbsp;: This adds a new triangle to the currently selected component. It works

<i>Reverse Direction </i>&nbsp;: Activating this function (checking it) will reverse the order of selected vertexes causing a triangle

<i>Check Components </i>&nbsp;: This checks components for any errors in them that might exist.

<i>Auto Assemble </i>&nbsp;: Some models are made up of seperate model files for example .md3 files.

as tags to match them up correctly.

<i>X Y Z Axis locks </i>&nbsp;: All three of these items work in the same manor but are independent from one another.

<b><u><a href="#viewsrmbmenus">Editor Face Options sub-menu :</a></u></b> This is the sub-menu described above and its functions in detail.<br>
(also located on the <a href="intro.modeleditor.menu.html#optionsmenu">Options menu</a>)

<i>Sync Skin-view with Editor views </i>&nbsp;: When checked this will synchronize the Skin-view with the Editor views
for either of the active selection options below, <g>Show selection in Skin-view</g> and <g>Pass selection to Skin-view</g>.

<i>Show selection in Skin-view </i>&nbsp;: Because the Skin-view and the rest of the editor views work independently,
this will pass selected editor model mesh triangle faces to the 'Skin-view' to be outlined and distinguish them. However,
it does not actually select them in the <a href="intro.modeleditor.skinview.html">Skin-view</a>. Any selections or deselections will
not show in the 'Skin-view' until the mouse buttons have been released. The <a href="intro.modeleditor.skinview.html">Skin-view</a>
outline color can be changed in the <a href="intro.modeleditor.toolpalettes.viewselection.html#coloroptions">Colors Options</a> settings.

<i>Pass selection to Skin-view </i>&nbsp;: This function will pass selected editor model mesh triangle faces  and select the
coordinated skin triangles in the <a href="intro.modeleditor.skinview.html">Skin-view</a> where they can be used for editing purposes.
Once the selection has been passed, if this function is turned off, the selection will remain in the
<a href="intro.modeleditor.skinview.html">Skin-view</a> for its use there. Any selections  or deselections will not show
in the <a href="intro.modeleditor.skinview.html">Skin-view</a> until the mouse buttons have been released.
The <a href="intro.modeleditor.skinview.html">Skin-view</a> selected face outline color can be changed in the
<a href="intro.modeleditor.toolpalettes.viewselection.html#coloroptions">Colors Options</a> settings.

<i>No face drag lines </i>&nbsp;: This will stop the selection and drawing of all drag lines when model mesh faces have
been selected which can increase the selection speed of the editor dramatically when a model with a large number of face
triangles is being edited.

<i>No face outlines </i>&nbsp;: This will stop the outlining of any models mesh faces have been selected. This will
increase the drawing speed of the editor dramatically when a model with a large number of face triangles is being edited.
The solid fill of selected faces will still be available.

<i>No face outlines while moving in 2D views </i>&nbsp;: Face outlining can be very taxing on the editors drawing speed
when panning (scrolling) or zooming in the <g>2D views</g> when a lot of the models mesh faces have been selected.
This is because so many views need to be redrawn repeatedly. If you experience this problem check this option to increase
the drawing and movement speed. The lines will be redrawn at the end of the move.

<i>No selection fill </i>&nbsp;: This stops the color filling and backface pattern from being drawn for any of the models
mesh faces that are selected. Only the outline of the selected faces will be drawn. This will not apply for any view that
has its <g>Fill in Mesh</g> function active (checked) in the
<a href="intro.modeleditor.toolpalettes.viewselection.html#viewoptions">Views Options</a> dialog.

<i>Front faces only </i>&nbsp;: This will only allow the solid color filling of the front faces to be drawn for any of the
models mesh faces that are selected. The back faces will be outlined allowing the models texture to be displayed if the
view is in <g>Textured</g> mode. This will not apply for any view that has its <g>Fill in Mesh</g> function active
(checked) in the <a href="intro.modeleditor.toolpalettes.viewselection.html#viewoptions">Views Options</a> dialog.

<i>Back faces only </i>&nbsp;: This will only allow the drawing of the backface pattern to be drawn for any of the models
mesh faces that are selected. The front faces will be outlined allowing the models texture to be displayed if the view is
in 'Textured' mode. This will not apply for any view that has its <g>Fill in Mesh</g> function active (checked) in the
<a href="intro.modeleditor.toolpalettes.viewselection.html#viewoptions">Views Options</a> dialog.

<i>Sync Skin-view with Editor views </i>&nbsp;: This function will turn off other related options and synchronize selected
Editor views mesh vertexes, passing and selecting the coordinated <g>Skin mesh vertexes</g> in the <a href="intro.modeleditor.skinview.html">Skin-view</a>,
where they can be used for editing purposes. Any selection changes in the Editor views will be updated to the
<a href="intro.modeleditor.skinview.html">Skin-view</a> as well. Once the selection has been passed, if this function is
turned off, the selection will remain in both the Editor and the <a href="intro.modeleditor.skinview.html">Skin-view</a> for further use.

coordinated <g>Model Skin mesh</g> vertexes in the <a href="intro.modeleditor.skinview.html">Skin-view</a>,
along with any others currently selected, where they can be used for editing purposes. Once the selection has been passed,

<i>No vertex drag lines </i>&nbsp;: This stops the multi selected Editor model mesh vertexes drag lines from being drawn,
but not the vertex outlines. Single vertex drag lines will also still be drawn.
