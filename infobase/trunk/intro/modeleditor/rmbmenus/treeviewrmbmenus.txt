author: cdunde

There are a number of <g>RMB menus</g> that apply specifically to the <g>Tree-view</g> and are pretty
well self explanatory so we will only cover a couple of them that need it.

<i>Force to grid </i>&nbsp;: This will cause any vertex to <g>snap</g> to the nearest location on
the editor's grid.

<i>Cut </i>&nbsp;: Cut the selection to the clipboard.

<i>Copy </i>&nbsp;: Copy the selection to the clipboard.

<i>Paste </i>&nbsp;: Paste a model object from the clipboard.

<i>Delete </i>&nbsp;: Delete the selection.

<i>Show Component </i>&nbsp;: This works in conjunction with the <g>Hide Component</g> function below.
It will redisplay the selected model component in the editor's view and cause it to become active again.

<i>Hide Component </i>&nbsp;: This works in conjunction with the <g>Show Component</g> function above.
When the selected model component is in this state it will not be drawn in the editor's view and becomes
inactive for various functions.

<i>Save Skin File </i>&nbsp;: Opens a file save window and allows you to save the selected skin as various
types of image files.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b><u>NOTE</u></b>: You can NOT save another type as a .pcx 
file because they do not have a <g>palette</g> like .pcx files do, this will only cause an error.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You CAN save a .pcx file to another file type like .tga though.

<i>Match Frame Count </i>&nbsp;: This will duplicate the number of frames in the selected components with the one
that has the most frames in it. It will not copy the frames, only how many there are.

<i>Duplicate Current Frame </i>&nbsp;: This copies a single frame that is currently selected and adds
that copy to that model component's animation frames list just below the frame being copied.
This can be used multiple times for the same single original frame. For multiple frame copies use the
<g>Duplicate</g> function on the <g>Edit</g> menu.

<i>Face Commands </i>&nbsp;: Performs the same as the
