Shaping is the process of creating a terrain by moving the <b>up</b> and/or the <b>down</b> <g>face</g> of adjoining <g>polys</g> that make up the terrain surface.

<b>QuArK</b> provides two vary powerful tools for you to work with in this process.<br>
The <b>Basic Selector</b> which will move both large and small areas of the terrain surface in a single operation.<br>
The <b>Touch-up Selector</b> that concentrates more on detail by selecting and moving a single vertex of a <b>primary face</b> and any other adjoining face that has a vertex that shares the same location position as the vertex that has been selected. It can also move the single <b>primary face</b> by its self.

As a general note, <b>none</b> of the <a href="intro.terraingenerator.selection.html">Terrain Generator Selectors</a> or the <a href="intro.terraingenerator.selection.html#paintbrush">Texture Applicator</a> will have any effect on terrain surface areas that are placed in a separate folder that is <b>hidden</b> by using that function which can be accessed using the 
<a href="intro.mapeditor.menu.html#editmenu">Edit menu-View Group</a> on QuArK's main Menubar or by clicking the <g>LMB,</g> with the mouse cursor over that particular folder and selecting <b>Group is hidden</b> from the pop-up menu.

This feature is especially useful when working on terrain areas that are close to, above or below other sections of terrain.
