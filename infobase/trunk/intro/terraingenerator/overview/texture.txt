title: Texture

Now that you have created your terrain surface, it is time to do some texturing to it. The texture that it starts with is the default texture that is set in <a href="intro.configuration.games.specificgames.html">QuArK's Configuration Settings</a>. You could, just as easily selected your texture prior to creating the terrain all together. Sometimes this may be desirable as a base and other times it may be better to apply it last or even <b>during</b> the creation process. Here, we will apply it now that the terrain <ref>../shaping</ref> has been completed.

To start with, select the desired area or, as here, the entire terrain surface. You can use the <a href="intro.terraingenerator.selection.html#basicselector">Terrain Selector</a> that you have been using thus far, but only the <g>faces</g> that are movable will receive texturing. If you wish to texture the entire <g>polys</g> then you must use one of <a href="intro.mapeditor.toolpalettes.mousemodes.html">QuArK's  Standard Selectors</a>.

<table width=100% cellspacing=0>
<tr><td valign=top align=middle>
<img border=1  align=middle>texture1.png</img>
</td></tr></table>

Then open <a href="intro.texturebrowser.overview.html">QuArK's Texture Browser</a>, select your texture as you would for any other <g>poly</g> and basically your terrain is complete!

<img border=1 align=right>texture3.png</img>
</td></tr></table>

Another powerful tool is the <a href="intro.terraingenerator.texture.html#paintbrush">Texture Applicator & Dialog Box</a> which in effect is a combination selector and "paint brush" function.

For complete detail of its applications and uses please go to the <a href="intro.terraingenerator.texture.html#paintbrush">Texture Applicator & Dialog Box</a> section of the <a href="intro.terraingenerator.texture.html">Texture</a> page.
