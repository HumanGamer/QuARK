The purpose of <a href="intro.terraingenerator.html">QuArK's Terrain Generator</a> is to allow the user to
actually create and edit their terrain at any time during the map
creation process. But with far more control over variation of
terrain size, scale, placement and usage to create unique surfaces
as well as the ability to <g>pull</g> the terrain to existing map items.

It is based on the solid <g>brush</g> (<g>polyhedron</g>) format that is now used
in QuArK for any other structure type. However, unlike most terrain
editor surfaces, which are based on units of squares that are converted
to triangles during the map file export process for importing to QuArK,
our terrain surface will start at that triangular unit stage.

Also, because the <g>Terrain Generator</g> was created around QuArK, it can
use many of the other existing features and functions that already existed.
The most vital one being <a href="intro.texturebrowser.overview.html">QuArK's Texture Browser</a> which will support
applying, changing and scaling of the terrain texture as it is being created or edited.

Another <b>very unique feature</b> of <a href="intro.terraingenerator.html">QuArK's Terrain Generator</a> is its ability to work with not <b>only</b> the <b>'up faces'</b> of the terrain surface, but the <b>'down faces'</b> and <b>both simultaneously</b> as well !!! You can read more about these functions on the <ref> ../selection </ref> page.
