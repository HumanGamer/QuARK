Another very nice <b>tool</b> is the <b>Adjacent Faces Selector</b> button. The function that it provides is that of selecting one particular face, either up , down or both, and then ,by clicking this button, having all of the adjoining faces that it touches added to your selection automatically.

This can create some very nice random and staggered effects to your terrain as illustrated below. Here, using just a slight amount of drag, we have created a rugged effect. Then by merely adding some grass and twig texturing to the flat area and fair size boulder texture to the random area, we have just given our surroundings a nice look with very little effort. Thank you Rowdy!
