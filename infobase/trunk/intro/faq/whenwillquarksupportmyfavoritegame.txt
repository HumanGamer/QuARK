title: When will QuArK to support my favorite game?
author: tiglari

That depends.  If the game is a Quake 1/2/3 engine game, it might happen
pretty quickly if you ask.  If it's a non-Quake engine 'corridor shooter'
(Unreal, Serious Sam, Max Payne), it would depend on how much of the work
you are able and willing to do.  It's fair to say that the QuArK coders do
not have time to fossick around in forums and web sites collecting technical
specifications and map format information, so if you can do that and present
a nice package, that would improve the chances (there's also the issue of
whether the game developers themselves impose restrictions on editing
their content).

If it's a landscape-based game such as Giants, the answer is probably Wno
(nullpointer at  <a href=http://www.planetcitizenkabuto.com>
http://www.planetcitizenkabuto.com</a> is planning to extend his
GiantsEdit to cover more games of that nature).

If you're interested in extending QuArK to deal with a new kind of
game, post on the <a href=http://www.egroups.com/messages/quark-python>
