title: How is QuArK different from other map editors?
author: tiglari (total replacement of Gryphon's original)

One difference between QuArK and many other editors is a consistent
emphasis on an easy-to-use and intuitive interface, with extensive
flyover hints and other forms of in-program documentation.  No need
to remember 50 combinations of hot keys to produce a map.  Initial
configuration is simply a matter of filling in fields indicating where
the games you're editing and their compiling tools are located, and when
you start the map editor for the first time, you're presented with a
basic map than you can run by hitting the 'GO' button.

There has also been extensive development of tools such as 'duplicators'
and 'shape builders' to help in creating complex patterns such as stairs,
arches and other sophisticated architecture.  If you know you need a row
of pillars but can't make up your mind about what texture to use on them,
you can use a duplicator, and changing the texture on the original will
automatically update the copies.

A final difference is that QuArK is as far as we know the only GPL (Gnu Public
License) game editor that is being actively developed, and is easy to extend to
accomodate a wide range of different games.  The GPL means, among other things,
that the QuArK developers can't impose any restrictions at all on what
you do with it, unlike editors supported by games companies, which can't
be used for games produced by other companies.  So if you are an aspiring
game-developer you can adapt QuArK for your own project, without
having to reveal editor source until you release the editing tools for
your game (actually you don't even have to do that, though we would certainly
hope that you would).
