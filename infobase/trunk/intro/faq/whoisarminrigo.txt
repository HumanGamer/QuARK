title: Who is Armin Rigo?
author: Gryphon

QuArK is programmed by Armin Rigo, a mathematics student from Lausanne Switzerland. Armin has been programming Quake related
utilities since Quake's release, and was the first one to release a program for de-compiling progs.dat files in order to study
the structure. This program, called DEACC, was quickly followed by REACC (used to facilitate re-compiling) and Armin has just
recently released a native 32bit version of DEACC called DEACC32. QuArK now incorporates parts of DEACC and REACC, into it's
QuakeC abilities, and you can easily add specific sections to an existing progs.dat file with QuArK's QuakeC tools, making it
extremely simple to add new functionality to your Quake maps.
