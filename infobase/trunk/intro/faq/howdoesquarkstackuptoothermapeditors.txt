title: How does QuArK stack up to other map editors?
author: Gryphon

Aside from the map-editor called BSP, QuArK is one of the most feature-rich editors in the community today. Rumours say, that
BSP's author has been hired by a gaming company, and development on this editor has been discontinued.

Worldcraft and QERadiant remain two of QuArK's other "rivals" in the area of level editing. As different people work
in different ways, it's not a "given" that any editor is immediately inferior to another based solely on features,
but on the whole, QuArK remains one of the easiest, and most powerful editor's out there. Part of QuArK's appeal (and sometimes
unappeal), is it's ability to do so many things, without needing to jump from one program to the next, or struggle to manage
your different media for a given project.

QuArK can read and play audio files, view models, display a variety of image and video formats.

In terms of raw feature comparisons, since many of these programs (including QuArK) are continually being updated, and nobody
has had time to make a least of all their "features", a clear comparison chart would be hard to compile.
