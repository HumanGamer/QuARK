title: Advanced features of the map editor
author: Armin Rigo / Decker

Beyond its basic features, the map editor has numerous advanced features which are not absolutely
necessary but that will still help you a lot, particularily on large maps. These features include duplicators, diggers, face
sharing, group masking, etc. Some features also come from plug-ins written by other people.
