title: Entities and other features that depend on the game only
author: Armin Rigo / Decker

As explained in <ref> ./compilingmaps </ref> above, some stuff depends on the game you are making maps for. This includes which
entities you can use, which settings of these entities you can change, and what these settings really do. The list of textures
you see in QuArK also depends on the game -- it's actually the list of the textures used in all the original maps of the game.
Some games also have per-face attributes that let you make polyhedrons translucent or light-emitting, for example.

A typical example of this are ladders. You first make a polyhedron structure with two vertical bars and a lot of horizontal
steps, but this is not enough to let the game know that the player should be able to climb there. The way you do the latter
depends on the game you are using. In Quake 2, for example, you must set a flag on the polyhedron faces (there is a button
"polyhedron flags" bottom left when you click on a polyhedron). But in Half-Life, you must use a special invisible entity
"func_ladder" and put it around the actual ladder structure. If you want to know the exact way to do this in QuArK, see
<ref> ./usingmapeditor </ref> above; but if you didn't know that you had to use a flag for Quake 2 and a "func_ladder" for
Half-Life, read on.

The game-dependant features are not related to QuArK itself: All the map editors available on the Internet will provide you
with a list of entities and textures and settings; what these settings actually do is programmed in the game itself. For
information about this subject, you can look for general documentation at <a href="http://www.planetquake.com">PlanetQuake</a>.
The other sources are Quake editing forums. You can use the one
<a href="http://www.planetquake.com/quark/forums.shtml">on the QuArK web site</a> (please mention explicitely which game you
are using!). See also the links (right column in the current design)
