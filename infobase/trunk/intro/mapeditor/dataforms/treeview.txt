This view actually contains your level! In here, you can arrange and group
objects; polyhedrons and entities, and plugin-functions like the duplicator.
You can see all entities you've put into your level, and what polyhedrons
belong to what entities.

You can right-mouse-click on every tree-view object, to get a context-menu,
from where you can select different actions.

Some of the more powerfull functions are:
<ul>
<li>Group objects together, and call the group: 'My Front Room', 'Monster Trap', 'Furniture' etc.
<li>Hide an entire group from the map-views, so it does not clutter your view.
<li>Change textures on all the selected polyhedrons (or faces).
<li>Cut, Copy, Paste and Move.
<li>Change colors on groups, to illustrate different things.
</ul>

If you wish to enlarge or reduce the Tree-view height, there is a hidden 'drag line' at the very top of the Tree-view, just below the compass. When your curser changes to two bars, with arrows above and below them, you can then hold the left mouse button down and drag the Tree-view to the height you desire.
