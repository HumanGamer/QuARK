Once you have created a new 3D-window, a 'eye'-icon will appear in your
map-views, showing where the camera are positioned in the level, and in what
direction its pointing.

You can move this camera around, and adjust its direction-handle, just like any
other entity. However the camera won't be a visible object in the
<ref>../dataforms/treeview </ref>, since it only exist when a 3D-window are
open.

If you have more than one 3D-window opened, there will also be more 'eye'-icons
in your map-views. One per 3D-window.

QuArK also has a function to set and store 3D camera views. This feature will
only work for the <b>Editor's</b> 3D view and not the separate 3D view windows or
the OpenGL window. To activate and use this function follow the steps below:

1) First, set your view or camera eye to where you want it in the 3D view.

2) In one of the 2D views RMB click on it and a bar will appear that says
<b>Add position</b>, LMB click the bar and a dialog input window will open that has,
next to Enter the name:,  <b>Camera Position</b>, put a number behind that so you
have like <b>Camera Position 1</b> now. There is also a check box below that, <b>local:</b>,
you can use to put that camera position into a group folder. If you do not have one
selected then it will make its own folder and you can put all of your camera
positions in that one folder. Once you have done this just hit your enter key
to close the dialog window and a <b>Camera position</b> entity will be created in the
<b>Tree View</b>. You can setup as many positions as you like. Then save your file
so you do not loose them, but you do not need to close the file.

3) To use those positions, hold down your <b>c key</b> and press your <b>Page Up</b> and
<b>Page Down</b> keys to move through each one.

4) Now here's the trick, or bug, when you do close that file and reopen it,
if you try to use the <b>c key</b>, <b>Page Up</b> and <b>Page Down</b> feature,
you will get an Information message that says <b>You need to set or store a view
first for this to work</b>. Instead of doing that, which you can also do to reset
any camera position by using your RMB over it, just close that message, go to
the <b>Search</b> menu and select <b>Find Camera Positions</b>. This will cause a dialog
window to open. Next to the <b>Positions</b> title click the down arrow and pick any
position, then click on the <b>V</b> button below it. This will take you to that 3D view
position AND reactivate the <b>c</b>,  <b>Page Up</b> and <b>Page Down</b> feature once again
for as long as you keep that session of QuArK open.
