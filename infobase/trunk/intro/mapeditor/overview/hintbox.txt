Whenever you see the text "<tt>Press <b>F1</b> for help</tt>" in the little
hintbox under the <a href="#dataform">dataform-display</a>, you can press F1
and get a Hint Pop-up window, which tells you a little more about the item
you are pointing at.

Some of the Hint Pop-up windows will have an InfoBase button that is linked
directly to a page in the InfoBase and will give you further help for the
item in question.

If you are new to QuArK, these hints and InfoBase links come in handy if you
do not know exactly what the item you are pointing at, does. So press <b>F1</b> to
get the hint and information available, before asking about it in the
<g>editing-newsgroups</g>.

Once you move your mouse outside the larger hintbox, it will automatically
disappear.
