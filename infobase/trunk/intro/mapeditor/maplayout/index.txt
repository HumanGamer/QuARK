These are the different map-layouts you can work in. Some might be easier to
understand than others, but that's up to you to choose one you like. You will
always be able to switch between layouts when you're working.
See <ref> ../menu/layoutmenu </ref> on how you change between these.

However, you should be aware that rotating the <ref> ../compass </ref> will
affect all 2D-views, so the X,Y,Z axises will correspond to the angle of the
compass. If you use the 4-views layouts, you should not need to change the
angle of the compass.
