<I><u>Quick double-cone maker</u></I>:  After you click this button, you can draw double-cones on the map with the <g>LMB</g>. Each double-cone will be turned into an actual poly.

The more sides that are added the more it becomes a double-cone shape.<br>
Move the mouse forward to add more faces, backwards for fewer faces, right to make it larger and left to make it smaller.<br>NOTE: Less than 3 faces will not draw anything.

Increasing the amount of its <a href="intro.mapeditor.toolpalettes.objectmodes.html#dialogboxes"><i>Object Distortion Dialog</i></a> will increase its height.<br>
Giving a negative amount will make it shorter.
