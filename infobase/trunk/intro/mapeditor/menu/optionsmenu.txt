<i>Delete unused faces & polys</i>. If this is unchecked, you will be able to
make invalid polyhedrons/faces. Always keep this marked, so QuArK will warn
you, when you are going to make an invalid polyhedron/face.

<i>Secondary red lines</i>. When this is marked, an extra set of red lines will
appear in the map-views. These can be used to reduce the selection-area of one
map-view, if you do the selection in the other.

<i>3D models in textured views</i>. Check this to see a 3D representation of
the entity-models, in textured views.

<i>Adjust angles automatically</i>. When this is checked, adjusting any angle,
like a face-angle or entity-angle, it will automatically adjust it to the
nearest angle, specified in <ref> intro/configuration/map/building </ref>.

<i>Paste objects at screen center</i>. Check this if you want objects that you
paste into the map-view, appear in the center of the current map-view. Uncheck
it, and it will paste it at the exact position as the original.

<i>Ignore groups marked so when building</i>. When this is marked, any group
marked <i>Ignore to build map</i> will not be available in the map when running
the FPS-game. Uncheck this if you want your entire map build.

<i>List of plug-ins</i>. Opens a window which shows what plug-ins QuArK has
loaded.

<i>Configuration</i>. Takes you to the <ref> intro/configuration </ref>.
