<i>Insert map item.</i> Activating this, will open the New map items window.

<i>Brush subtraction.</i> To subtract one <g>brush</g> from another, you mark;<br>
- first the brush you want the subtraction to occur on,<br>
- then the brush that should be subtracted from the first.<br>
Then you activate this menuitem, or press the accellerator key <b>CTRL+B</b>.

<i>Face sharing subtraction.</i> This is an advanced brush subtraction method.
If a <g>face</g> from the originally brush, will be split up into multiple
faces by the subtraction, it will actually be converted into a face, which is
shared by the brushes that will be created by the brush-subtraction. Read more
about <ref> maped/tutorial/advanced/facesharing </ref>.

<i>Make hollow</i> will create a polyhedron for each face the selection has,
and delete the original selected polyhedrons. The inflate/deflate value in the
Movement configuration window, determines the thickness of the new polyhedrons,
and if they should occupy (negative value) or surround (positive value) the
original selected polyhedrons.

<i>Intersection.</i> This is basically a kind of <i>brush adding</i> function.
It will try to create a new polyhedron which occupy the common area of the
selected polyhedrons.

<i>Dissociate duplicator images.</i> Only active when you have marked a
duplicator. This will create actual copies of the duplicator-object(s), and
remove the duplicator itself.

<i>Orientation.</i> Only active when you have selected a <g>face</g>. It will
bring up a window where you can edit some attributes about that face. However,
its not recommended that you do it this way, unless you know what you're doing!

<i>Adjust angle.</i> Only active when you have selected a face. This will bring
the angle of the face on the polyhedron, to the nearest angle by which you
specified in the <ref> intro/configuration/map/building </ref>.

<i>Delete face.</i> As it says. However, deleting a face will very likely make
a polyhedron invalid.

<i>Cone over face.</i> This will create a new set of faces in style as a cone,
over the selected face. The number of new faces will be the number of
<g>edges</g> the selected face has.

<i>Swap face sides.</i> Will swap the face inside-out. Do not use this, unless
you really want to!

<i>Extend selection</i> will include adjacented polyhedrons of your selection,
to it. This way you can mark one polyhedron, and extend the selection to
everything that it touches.

<i>Tag side.</i> This menuitem are created by an <g>plug-in</g>. It allows you
to select, or tag as it says, a <g>face</g> of an polyhedron. With a
tagged-face, the next three menuitems becomes active.

<i>Clear tag.</i> Removes the tag.

<i>Glue to tagged.</i> Another selected face or polyhedron, can be glued to the
tagged face. Very usefull if you want another face to touch the tagged-face, so
it will be somewhat seamless.

<i>Wrap texture from tagged.</i> Should wrap the texture of the polyhedron,
around it, so it has fluent seams.
