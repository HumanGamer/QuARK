<i>Remove selection.</i> Deselects whatever is selected.

<i>Select parent.</i> If something is selected, switches the selection to
that thing's parent in the map structure.  For example if a face is selected,
the selection will change to the face's parent brush (or group, if the face
is shared between the brushes of a group).

<i>Select child.</i> If something is selected, switches the selection to that
thing's first child.

<i>Select next/previous.</i> If something is selected, these commands
switch the selection to the next or previous sibling of that thing
in the tree-view.

<i>Freeze selection.</i>  Sometimes, when you are working on a brush
or a patch, it is annoyingly easy to loose the selection by accidently
clicking in the wrong place in the map.  This command 'freezes' the selection
so that that can't happen.  You can also freeze the selection by left-clicking
with the <Shift> key down.  Frozen selections can be changed in the treeview,
or by <Shift>-left-clicking, and can be removed & unfrozen with <ESC>,
or just unfrozen with Unfreeze selection below.

<i>Unfreeze selection.</i>  If the selection is frozen, this command
unfreezes it, so that selection works by simple left-clicking again.

<i>Select tagged.</i>  If there are multiple tagged faces, this command
turns them into a multiple selection of those faces (which can be dragged
together, or manipulated in other ways).

<i>Invert face selection.</i> If a face or faces are selected, this changes
the selection to the currently non-selected faces in the same brush(es).

<i>Extend selection from face.</i> If a face is selected, this extends
the selection to all faces (of other brushes) that adjoin this face and
occupy the same plane.  Useful for moving large collection of faces
together.

<i>Browse multiple selection.</i> If you have a multiple selection, this
creates a dialog from which you can choose individual elements of the
multiple selection to select and work on in turn.

<i>Restrict to selection.</i> This 'restricts' the map editor to working
only on what is selected (when the command is given).  Other material
will either disappear or be greyed out (depending on the grey/hide out
of view setting, or disappear entirely in the textured 3d views), and
can't be selected.

<i>Unrestrict selection.</i> Reverses the effect of Restrict to Selection,
allowing editing of the whole map again.

<i>Zoom to selection.</i> Zooms the map views in to the selection.

<i>Mark selection/clear mark</i> These commands designate/undesignate the
selection as a special element for other (mostly somewhat advanced)
commands, such as 'Lift face to marked group' on the face RMB, or the
Reorganize Tree commands on various map object RMB's.
