New commands are constantly being added to the main menus; if there is
no F1 help for some command not listed here, or you can't understand
what it says, post to the <a href=groups.yahoo.com/group/quark>QuArK
messageboard</a> for help (and a heads-up to the docco writers).

Most of the commands on the menus also have hot keys (accelerators), which
you can customize from Configuration at the bottom of the
<ref>intro/mapeditor/menu/optionsmenu</ref>.
