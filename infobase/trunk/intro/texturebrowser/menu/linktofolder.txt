If you have a large collection of textures you can use this to create all the
groups for you.  Create a new main folder (see above), then click the <i>Link
to folder</i> button, you will be asked to select the directory containing the
textures.  After a short search QuArK will add one
<ref> ./newtexturelist </ref> to the new main folder for each
<g>.PAK</g> or <g>.WAD</g> file that contains textures and
each folder under the one you select which also contains textures.
