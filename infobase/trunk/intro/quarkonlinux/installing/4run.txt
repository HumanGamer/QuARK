title: Running QuArK
author: slightcrazed, Peter Brett, DanielPharos

The QuArK installer by default will create a shortcut on your Linux
desktop. To run QuArK manually, follow the next steps:

Example: My Wine directories are located in my <tt>/home</tt> folder
under Wine.

<code>
cd /home/slight/Wine/C/QuArK\ 6.3/
wine QuArK.exe
</code>

<b>Note</b>:
Older versions of QuArK and Wine seem to only function correctly
when you to cd into the install directory in a terminal and run
the executables by hand.

<b>Note</b>:
In some distributions, the Wine folder is hidden by default. Check
<tt>/home/user/.wine</tt> instead.
