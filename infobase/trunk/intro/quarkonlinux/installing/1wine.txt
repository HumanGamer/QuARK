title: Get Wine with OpenGL Support
author: slightcrazed, Peter Brett, DanielPharos

Wine (Wine Is Not an Emulator) is a nifty bit of programming that
allows for Windows binaries to run on a Linux/Unix platform through
the use of a compatibility layer. This extra layer of programming lies
between the binaries and the operating system, and it 'tricks' the
executable into thinking it is running on a Windows machine. If you
don't have Wine, you'll need to obtain it from 
<a target=_blank href="http://www.winehq.org/">http://www.winehq.org</a>. I
used Wine release 20030911, but any of the newer versions will work.
Wine release 20031118 is the most recent version at the time of this
writing. Of course, you will need Wine to be compiled with OpenGL
support, both for QuArK to display the OpenGL 3D window.  This
<a href="http://lhl.linuxgames.com/howto/half-life-HOWTO-0.5.html">article</a>
at Linuxgames.com is the best I know of for compiling Wine with OpenGL
support, and I am not going to take the time to re-write what has
already been written (the article also explains how to install
Half-Life).

<b>Update</b>: Newer versions of Wine (often distributed with your
Linux distribution) work too, and often have OpenGL enabled by default.
In other words, your distribution-supplied copy should work fine,
and if you compile it yourself, just make sure that no OpenGL-libraries
are missing (see the output of the "configure" compilation step).
