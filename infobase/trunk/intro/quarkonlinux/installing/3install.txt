title: Install QuArK

<b>Using the installer</b>:

Open a terminal window, move to the directory you downloaded the file
to, and run the installer.

<code>
$ cd /path/to/quark
$ wine quark_v6.3.0.EXE
</code>

You can put the file anywhere you want, but it is probably
easiest to use the default place it the installer suggests.


<b>Using the archive</b>:

Open a terminal window and unzip the the file to the desired location.

<code>
$ unzip quark-win32-<blah>.zip
</code>
