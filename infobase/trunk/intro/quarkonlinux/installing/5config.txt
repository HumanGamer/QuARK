title: Configuring QuArK
author: DanielPharos

Configuring QuArK under Wine works in the same way as configuring
QuArK under Windows. As many compilers and game play tricks with
paths, you may need to install (or symlink) them to Wine's "C" drive,
and configure QuArK to use them from there.

If you are getting weird behaviour, make sure Wine is configured to
emulate "Windows XP".
