<u>Additional options</u>

<i>Back buffer format</i>. The format of the back buffer used by
DirectX. This is the color format of the pixels. The higher the better
the quality, but not all formats might be supported.

<i>Depth buffer bits</i>. The amount of bits per pixel in the depth
buffer. The higher the number, the less chance of objects being rendered
overlapping while they're not. Not all modes might supported.

<i>Color dithering</i>. When enabled, DirectX will dither colors.

<i>Face culling</i>. Speeds up rendering by making all the backsides of
faces invisible. This doesn't apply to transparent faces.

<i>High floating point precision</i>. Enabled high precision in floating
point calculations. Setting this increases rendering accuracy, but also
degrades performance.
