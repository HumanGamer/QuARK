Settings in this folder are only usable if you have a Glide 2.4
or compatible graphics-card.

3D-accelerators like 3dfx, Voodoo, Voodoo-II and other low-price cards, are
<u>not</u> true OpenGL compatible, they only emulates it through a
Glide-driver.

<i>Second monitor on Glide</i>.

<i>Full-screen gamma correction</i>.

<i>Full-screen size</i>.

<i>Isometric transparent fraction</i>.

<i>Fade</i>. With this you can enable and disable the fading fog.


<u>Additional options</u>

<i>Resolution</i>. This is the resolution Glide renders at. The higher
this setting, the higher the quality, but also the slower the
rendering.

<i>Mirroring</i>. Allows you to flip the viewport around. Use this if everything renders upside-down.

<i>Color dithering</i>. Reduces color banding when downscaling colors,
at the cost of some additional noise.

<i>Face culling</i>. Speeds up rendering by making all the backsides of
faces invisible.

<i>Disable desktop composition</i>. On some systems, the desktop
composition feature may corrupt the rendered viewport. Enable this
option to automatically disable the desktop composition feature when a
viewport opens.

Note: Usage of emulators (such as <a target="_blank" href="http://dege.freeweb.hu/">dgVoodoo</a>)
might produce weird effects, and is generally not supported.
