Settings in this folder are only usable if you have a true Glide
graphics-card.

3D-accelerators like 3Dfx, Voodoo, Voodoo-II and other low-price cards, are
<u>not</u> true OpenGL compatible, they only emulates it through a
Glide-driver.

<i>Second monitor on Glide</i>.

<i>Full-screen gamma correction</i>.

<i>Full-screen size</i>.

<i>Isometric transparent fraction</i>.


<u>Additional options</u>

<i>Fade</i>. With this you can enable and disable the fading fog.

<i>Resolution</i>. This is the resolution Glide renders at. The higher
this setting, the higher the quality, but also the slower the
rendering.

<i>Mirroring</i>. Allows you to flip the viewport around. Use this if everything renders upside-down.

Note: Usage of emulators (such as <a target="_blank" href="http://dege.freeweb.hu/">dgVoodoo</a>)
might produce weird effects, and is generally not supported.
