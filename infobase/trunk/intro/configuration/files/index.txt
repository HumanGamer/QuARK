In QuArK, many different types of files can be loaded and saved. The most
important are of course the maps themselves, but QuArK can also handle textures,
models, archive files and more! Some of these files QuArK can understand
natively; that means, without any external library or additional third-party
software. Most picture however are loaded through a set of libraries, and
there are settings (like quality) in these libraries that can be set to produce
exactly the kind of file you want. This section in the configuration lets you
pick those settings.

Note: If a particular file doesn't load correctly with one library, try another
one! (If available)
