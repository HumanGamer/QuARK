In QuArK, many different types of files can be loaded and saved. The most
important are of course the maps themselves, but QuArK can also handle textures,
models, archive files and more! Some of these files QuArK can understand
natively; that means, without any external library or additional third-party
software. Most pictures however are loaded through a set of libraries, and
there are settings (like quality) in these libraries that can be set to produce
exactly the kind of file you want. This section in the configuration lets you
pick those settings.

Warning: Not all different formats or image types (like progressive JPG or
compressed BMP files) are supported by all game engines. Be careful when
changing those settings.

Note: If a particular file doesn't load or save correctly with one library, try
another one! (If available)
