Controls some default values, that will affect your map-making.

<i>Def. brush with entities</i>. Select the size of a default cube you want,
when creating a new entity.

<i>Wall width (for Make Hollow)</i>. The default thickness in units, the make
hollow action should result in.

<i>Force angle to (degrees)</i>. The closest minimum degree angle, a rotation
should snap to.

<i>NormalizeColors</i>. Many games normalize color-specifics, so that only
the relative RGB-values matter. In order for the coloring to match while
editing, QuArK does this too. Turn off this option to disable this behavior.
