In the configuration-window you can specify many things, to change the lookout
and feel of QuArK. It is <u>recommended</u> that you study these settings, to
learn what can and can't be done in QuArK.

Also, as QuArK is constantly going through changes, it would be wise to study
the fly-over hints of the controls you're pointing at.

You can access the configuration-window by opening the <tt>Edit</tt> menu and then
selecting the <tt>Configuration</tt> option when you aren't in the map/model editor,
or using <tt>Options</tt> and then <tt>Configuration</tt> when you have opened a map or model.
