title: Path substitution

When configuring games, often you need to specify a gamepath. In
order to not have to copy-paste this path all over the place, QuArK
supports path substitution. For example, instead of <tt>+set fs_game C:\Quake3</tt>
you can use <tt>+set fs_game %gamedir%</tt>. QuArK will
substitute/expand the <tt>%gamedir%</tt> when calling the external
tool.

<tt>%mapfile%</tt>: The path and filename with file extension of the output map file.<br/>
