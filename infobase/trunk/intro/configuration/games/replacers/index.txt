title: Path substitution

When configuring games, often you need to specify a gamepath. In
order to not have to copy-paste this path all over the place, QuArK
supports path substitution. For example, instead of <tt>+set fs_game C:\Quake3</tt>
you can use <tt>+set fs_game %gamedir%</tt>. QuArK will
substitute/expand the <tt>%gamedir%</tt> when calling the external
tool.

<b>Table of tokens</b>
<table border=1 cellpadding=2 cellspacing=0>
<tr><td><tt>%output%</tt></td><td>The output path.</td></tr>
<tr><td><tt>%grouppath%</tt></td><td>The path where files belonging to a group are stored (Torque).</td></tr>
<tr><td><tt>%buildpgmsdir%</tt></td><td>The path where the tool is installed (only applicable to external tools).</td></tr>
<tr><td><tt>%mappath%</tt></td><td>The path where QuArK writes the output map file.</td></tr>
<tr><td><tt>%mapfile%</tt></td><td>The path and filename with file extension of the output map file.</td></tr>
<tr><td><tt>%mapfile_wrongslash%</tt></td><td>Some tools don't accept the right type of slashes in filepaths; this token is the same as <tt>%mapfile%</tt>, but with the type of slashes set incorrectly on purpose.</td></tr>
<tr><td><tt>%file%</tt></td><td>The path and filename without file extension of the output map file.</td></tr>
<tr><td><tt>%filename%</tt></td><td>The filename without file extension of the output map file.</td></tr>
<tr><td><tt>%fullfilename%</tt></td><td>The filename with file extension of the output map file.</td></tr>

If the game has Steam-support, these additional tokens are available:
<table border=1 cellpadding=2 cellspacing=0>
<tr><td><tt>%sourcesdkdir%</tt></td><td>The directory where the Source SDK tools are located inside the user's SteamApps directory.</td></tr>
<tr><td><tt>%steampath%</tt></td><td>The path where Steam is installed.</td></tr>
