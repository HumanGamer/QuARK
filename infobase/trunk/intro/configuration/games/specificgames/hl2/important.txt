Here are a few things everybody should keep in mind when setting up Half-Life 2:
<ul>
<li>You will need the Source SDK installed. To do this, open Steam's Tools tab
and install it. The Source SDK contains the compilers needed to create the map
files.
<li>After an update to either Steam or the Source SDK, the SDK files might not
be in a consistent state anymore. Launch the Source SDK; this should refresh
the files. You can also use the 'Refresh Source SDK files' option to make sure
everything is OK.
<li>You will need to have run the game at least once, for the data files to be
properly extracted, so QuArK can find them.
</ul>
