<b>Command-line arguments</b>
If you used the DOS Command Prompt to run the map2dif_DEBUG.exe file you would see the settings that are used in the <tt>"...fixed command-line arguments"</tt> for each program setting above in the <a href="intro.configuration.games.specificgames.torque.html#config">Configuration</a> section.

There is really nothing you need to change, but it is a good way to learn how these effect what steps QuArK is being instructed to perform.

You will also notice that it displays the Program version and Built date so that you know exactly what version you are currently running.
