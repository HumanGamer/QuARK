<b>Installing the q3map_2.5.16_win32_x86 build tool</b>

When you install this program you will need to direct it to the
<a href="intro.configuration.games.specificgames.rtcw.html#config">QuArK files</a> folder as shown
earlier in the <a href="intro.configuration.games.specificgames.rtcw.html#config">Configuration section</a>.
That is really all you need to verify.

<b>Changing and re-running a map</b>

Normally, I run RTCW in a separate window, instead of its "Full Screen" mode when working on
a map, for a couple of reasons.<br>
First it's a lot easer to see around to view something in the
editor that you might be concentrating on with your work.<br>
The other is being able to jump back
and forth between the editor and the game running by simply holding down the Alt key and
pressing the Tab key to switch.<br>
It seems less confusing that way.

Unfortunately it does not have the ability to make changes in your map while the game is still running
and then rebuild and reload the map.<br>
To do this you will need to close the game and go through the normal process once again.<br>
But basically all you need to do is just click the QuArK menu item and off you go.

To close the game, press the Esc key and select "Exit" from its menu.

<b>Custom textures or models not showing Textures</b>

Open the model .mdc or md3 file with a text editor such as NotePad or WordPad,
Do a search for "tga" to find the textures that the model uses, you will see the full path.
Extract those textures and make new folders, with the exact same name and additional
sub-folder(s), in your "Main" folder and place them in those folders.

Or you can just extract the entire "textures" folder from the .pak file and place that,
with all the textures, inside the "Main" folder. BUT...if you use this method it could
over write some of the QuArK_RTCW support textures image files. So it would be a good
idea to re-install those afterwards, just to be sure everything is the way it should be.

This will also add those textures to the QuArK Texture Browser causing them to show up twice.
The original ones are most likely "shaders" but the new ones will only be "standard" textures.

If a model is not displaying all of its "skin" textures and the texture image file (.tga or .jpg)
is already in the proper folder location then it is very likely that it is a "script\shader"
type of texture. Use its full path and name but without its suffix (.tga or .jpg) and do a
search for it in the "scripts" folder and .pak files. Once you have located it look to see if
it has a code line something like this:

	rgbGen lightingdiffuse

If it does then that could be causing the problem. Copy that entire section of that shader code
that starts with the full path and name along with, and including, the starting "left curly
bracket" { and ending with the "right curly bracket" } and add it to the quarkcharacters.shader
file in the "scripts" folder in your "Main" RTCW directory. Then comment that line out like this:

   // rgbGen lightingdiffuse

This will turn off that particular code function and the model skin texture should now show up.

<b>Texture Loading Game Error</b>

It has come to our attention while setting up the QuArK_RTCW.zip file that there is at least
one texture in the original RTCW pak0.pk3 file (textures\common\blackish.jpg) that causes RTCW
to give an error in the game console that says:

Error: LoadTGA: Only type 2 (RGB), 3 (gray), and 10 (RGB) TGA images supported

and stops the game map from loading. The texture file itself is not bad, but for some unknown
reason when this texture is used in QuArK and is opened in an "external editor", like PaintShopPro,
it shows as a .pcx file and not a .jpg uncompressed file. When it is exported for the map file
by QuArK, it is created as a .tga file, which is not the case at all, and causes this error.

So if you should receive this game error message this is what you should do.
Clear out your "tmpQuArK\textures" folder, have QuArK "Prepare all textures and scripts", which is
on the RTCW main menu in QuArK, then open each .tga and .jpg texture in the textures folder directly
into PSP or Photo Shop. You are looking for two things:

1) That is IS a valid .jpg or .tga file.

2) And, that it is NOT a "compressed" image file.
   RTCW will give the same error is one is.

Once you find the offending file(s), create an uncompressed .tga file of it and place that new file
in a folder called "textures" in your RTCW\Main folder. That will solve all the problems for both
QuArK and RTCW, allowing you to continue to use that texture in the future.
Please notify us so we can make the same correction.


<b>Other Comments</b>

Some entities and\or models do not work properly or at all. These are erroneous items that were not
done correctly by other parties and is not a bug with QuArK. However, other entities may not have
been fully understood as to their proper needs and settings which could be an item to bring to our
attention for correction.
