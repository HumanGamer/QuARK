<b>Installing the q3map_2.5.16_win32_x86 build tool</b>

When you install this program you will need to direct it to the
<a href="intro.configuration.games.specificgames.rtcw.html#config">QuArK files</a> folder as shown
earlier in the <a href="intro.configuration.games.specificgames.rtcw.html#config">Configuration section</a>.
That is really all you need to verify.

<b>GtkRadiantSetup-1.4.0-Q3RTCWET.exe</b>

This is another, self extracting, program that you should
<a href="http://www.q3radiant.com/index.php?data=dlselect&query_dlsel=1&OS_dlsel%5B%5D=1&Release_dlsel%5B%5D=3&Games_dlsel%5B%5D=2">download from here</a> and install.
This will add additional pak files, maps, models and scripts folders and their files to RTCW. These files will not replace any
of the original files already there. But it does GREATLY enhance the textures that will be displayed
in <a href="intro.texturebrowser.overview.html">QuArK's Texture Browser</a> that are available for
use in map editing.

Also during this installation it will ask if you want a Full installation or a Custom installation.<br>
Because it supports a number of different games (RTCW, Wolfenstein - Enemy Territory and Quake III Arena).<br>
The Custom option allows you to choose which game you want to install its files for, all of these are already
checked for a Full installation.<br>
Just be sure that you install for RTCW if you choose the Custom option.

<b>Changing and re-running a map</b>

Normally, I run RTCW in a separate window, instead of its "Full Screen" mode when working on
a map, for a couple of reasons.<br>
First it's a lot easer to see around to view something in the
editor that you might be concentrating on with your work.<br>
The other is being able to jump back
and forth between the editor and the game running by simply holding down the Alt key and
pressing the Tab key to switch.<br>
It seems less confusing that way.

Unfortunately it does not have the ability to make changes in your map while the game is still running
and then rebuild and reload the map.<br>
To do this you will need to close the game and go through the normal process once again.<br>
But basically all you need to do is just click the QuArK menu item and off you go.

To close the game, press the Esc key and select "Exit" from its menu.
