There are various ways in QuArK to deal with sound editing by using .wav files. But because all
of these files are stored in the games .pak files, they can not be used directly in QuArK. So in
that case their path and full file name would need to be typed in where needed by hand.
This is not only cumbersome but leaves a lot of room for errors. Because of this, we have setup
"sound file selectors" where they are needed in the DataET.qrk file for various entities when
they use sound input settings. The only requirement to use this feature is that the "sound" folder
needs to be extracted from the games .pak files.

<b>Extracting .pak files & their placement</b>

The games .pak files are nothing more than a type of .zip compression file and can easily be accessed
to extract individual files or entire folders by either using a program that can extract ZIP files,
<link download_tools>PakScape v0.11</link> (my personal favorite) or any other archive program.

Once you have opened the .pak file, select the "sound" folder and drag it into your RTCW-ET "etmain" folder.
You can now go to that "sound" folder by simply clicking on the "sound file selectors" button that looks
like this ... and just select that sound.wav file that you want to use for any entity that has a selector.

<b>Custom Sounds and Functions</b>

By having the "sound" folder extracted and placed, as described above, you can now place any .wav file
in that folder and select it for sound editing use. There is one important criteria though. The name of the
.wav file must NOT have any blank spaces in its name or it will not be located and played in the game.
You can, however, use lower dashes _ instead of spaces to separate words in its name.

If you wish to distribute any custom sound files with your map, just create a .pak file
(using any ZIP-capible program and then renaming the ZIP-file to .pk3 or
<link download_tools>PakScape v0.11</link>) and place a folder
called "sound" in it with your custom.wav files located in that folder.

When using a "sound file selector", there are a couple of nice functions that are available to you by clicking
your <g>RMB</g> while you have your mouse cursor over a particular .wav file. This will bring up a standard
system pop-up menu where you can select to either <b>Play</b> it before you actually select it (very handy), <b>Rename</b>
it, change it's <b>Properties</b> or even <b>Delete</b> it, among other things.

Once a .wav file has been selected, QuArK will automatically trim its path and make other necessary changes
so that the sound will now play properly in the game.

<b>If a Sound Does Not Play</b>

There is ONE exception to the rule here that I have found only with the "worldspawn" entity sound setting which will
NOT play when your map is first loaded into the game after a build sometimes. If that should be the case for ANY sound
file, the first thing you want to try is reloading your map while still in the game.

To do this just press the <b>~</b> Tilde key to bring down the game console then type in <b>\map (your map name)</b>
 press <b>Enter</b> and it should solve the problem when your map reloads. If that does not work, then something else is
causing this issue such as improper format <b>Properties</b> of the .wav file itself, which you can check
by comparing those to another .wav file that does play and changing it to that type of format,
using the <g>RMB</g> method I described above. That pretty well covers it for sound editing.
