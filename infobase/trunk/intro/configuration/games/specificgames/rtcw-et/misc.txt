<b>Installing the q3map_2.5.16_win32_x86 build tool</b>

When you install this program you will need to direct it to the
<a href="intro.configuration.games.specificgames.rtcw-et.html#config">QuArK files</a> folder as shown
earlier in the <a href="intro.configuration.games.specificgames.rtcw-et.html#config">Configuration section</a>.
That is really all you need to verify.

<b>Changing and re-running a map</b>

Normally, I run RTCW-ET in a separate window, instead of its "Full Screen" mode when working on
a map, for a couple of reasons.<br>
First it's a lot easer to see around to view something in the
editor that you might be concentrating on with your work.<br>
The other is being able to jump back
and forth between the editor and the game running by simply holding down the Alt key and
pressing the Tab key to switch.<br>
It seems less confusing that way.

Unfortunately it does not have the ability to make changes in your map while the game is still running
and then rebuild and reload the map.<br>
To do this you will need to close the game and go through the normal process once again.<br>
But basically all you need to do is just click the QuArK menu item and off you go.

To close the game, press the Esc key and select "Exit game" from its menu.

<b>Custom textures or models not showing Textures</b>

Extensive work has been done creating the QuArK_RTCW-ET.zip file to eliminate this problem.
However, if you should encounter this kind of issue, read this same section on the 
<a href="intro.configuration.games.specificgames.rtcw.html#misc">RTCW Configuration</a>
page as to what you should do.

<b>Texture Loading Game Error</b>

Although this has not been found to be an issue with Enemy Territory, so far, it has come to our 
attention while working with <b>Return to Castle Wolfenstein</b> that there is at least
one texture in the original RTCW pak0.pk3 file (textures\common\blackish.jpg) that causes RTCW
to give an error in the game console that says:

Error: LoadTGA: Only type 2 (RGB), 3 (gray), and 10 (RGB) TGA images supported

and stops the game map from loading. If you should receive this game error message, read this same
section on the <a href="intro.configuration.games.specificgames.rtcw.html#misc">RTCW Configuration</a>
page as to what you should do.


<b>Other Comments</b>

Some entities and\or models do not work properly or at all. These are erroneous items that were not
done correctly by other parties and is not a bug with QuArK. However, other entities may not have
been fully understood as to their proper needs and settings which could be an item to bring to our
attention for correction.
