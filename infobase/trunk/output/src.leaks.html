Memproof<a> reveals a substantial assortment of resource and memory
leaks.  Unfortunately it's not entirely clear which ones are genuine
and which ones are Memproof misreports or Delphi bugs, but it is possible
that most of the really important ones have been dealt with.
</p><p>So here are listed various things that still appear, organized by
when they show up, followed by some other items.
These leaks only include those reported when the
`specifics sharing' scheme is disabled, by compiling with the flag
`Noshare'.  Sorting the apparent specifics-sharing scheme leaks out
is a challenge we have not yet risen to (since specifics sharing is
arcane, involves assembler code, etc., the reports may well be spurious).
As of 6.5.0 Beta 2, a lot of these problems have been fixed, however
some might remain.
</p><p>Developer Mode in QuArK also enables a command to track memory usage,
and compare current used message to that from the last call to it.
This can be used to tell if inordinate amounts of memory are being
consumed by map editing operations (of course the undo stack will get
bigger as editing procedes, etc.).

<p>There are many tools out there that can be used to locate and
eliminate memory leaks.  Here's a small list of some of them,
and where to find them:
</p><p><strong>WinDBG (Debugging Tools for Windows)</strong><br>
Microsofts official debugging tools.  Might come in handy, but
it can only be used on the actual executable, and thus can
only be applied when searching for leaks the hard way, or for
locating crashes.
</p><p>Location:
-none-<br>
Website:
<a target=_blank href="http://www.microsoft.com/whdc/devtools/debugging/default.mspx">www.microsoft.com/whdc/devtools/debugging/default.mspx</a>
</p><p><strong>MemProof</strong><br>
A program that monitors the executable realtime, and lists
memory usage.  When the program finishes, all the memory still
being used has obviously leaked.
</p><p>Location:
source/prog/MemP0950/*<br>
Website:
<a target=_blank href="http://www.automatedqa.com/products/memproof/">www.automatedqa.com/products/memproof/</a>
</p><p><strong>MemCheck</strong><br>
Being an alternative memory manager, this replaces the old
MemTester.pas that QuArK uses at the moment.  This has already
been done: all you need to do is to open the .dpr file in the
source directory, comment out MemTester, comment in MemCheck
AND the MemChk below at the end of the file, and you're done.
</p><p>Location:
source/prog/MemCheck274/*<br>
Website:
<a target=_blank href="http://v.mahon.free.fr/pro/freeware/memcheck/">v.mahon.free.fr/pro/freeware/memcheck/</a>
</p><p><strong>FastMM</strong><br>
Another alternative memory manager.  This one is actually so
good, that even Borland (developers of Delphi) started using
this in Delphi 2006!  But it's too good for QuArK: the amount
of leaks it finds, and the amount of crashes broken pointers
produce make the program unworkable.  These should (of course)
be fixed ASAP.
It has a settings file, source/prog/FastMM4Options.inc. To
enable the Full Debug Mode, you will need to place a DLL file
into your runtime directory.  See the FastMM readme file for
more information.

Website:
<a target=_blank href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/fastmm/">sourceforge.net/projects/fastmm/</a>
</p>
<p>Also, don't forget:<br>
There are a lot of debugging options already present in
Delphi (at least in 6 and higher).  Don't forget to check
the Project&gt;Options&gt;Compiler/Compiler Messages/Linker
settings in Delphi.  Also, some of these options have to
be enabled in order to use the full power of the tools
listed above.  Read the respective readme file that comes
with the tool for more information.

<p>The kernel error CreatEvent generated at QkFileObjects.pas:RestoreAutoSaved
line 2061 should not be fixed by deleting the event; here's what Decker had
to say about my attempt to do that:
</p><p>Oops I believe you just introduced &quot;an unintended bug&quot;.
</p><p>I've looked at that particular piece of code before (less than a month
ago I think), and made up my mind of what it does. Unfortunatly I never
got around to document it. Armin should have done that, when he coded
it. It has something to do, when running two or more instances of QuArK
on the same machine at the same time, and the crashes of QuArK.
</p><p>Here's my thoughts of it:
</p><p>- The procedure is called &quot;RestoreAutoSaved&quot;, so it might have something
to do with when QuArK crashes and is started again.<br>
- There is a call to &quot;GetCurrentProcessId&quot; at the bottom of the
procedure. So some kind of 'uniqueness' is apparently needed.<br>
- The call to &quot;WaitForSingleObject&quot; has a timeout-value of 0, e.g. don't
wait (quite strange!?).<br>
- The file named &quot;auto-save-<something>&quot;, is also referenced in the
procedure &quot;QFileObject.PyGetAttr&quot;, where it too use
&quot;GetCurrentProcessId&quot;.<br>
- &quot;OldId&quot; gets assigned the value from the file named
&quot;auto-save-<something>&quot;.<br>
- So &quot;OldId&quot; may actually be the ProcessId of the QuArK-instance which
created the auto-save file.<br>
- Note that the const &quot;TagAtom&quot; with value &quot;~QuArK-tag-auto-save-%x&quot;,
gets its &quot;%x&quot; replaced by &quot;OldId&quot;.<br>
- The Delphi documentation for &quot;CreateEvent()&quot; does not directly states
what will be returned, if the name-of-the-event-semaphore already exists
(e.g. another instance of QuArK is already running.) I believe that we
get an invalid handle back in that case.<br>
- The &quot;WaitForSingleObject()&quot; call, destroys &quot;OldId&quot; and assigns it a
completly different purpose; it now contains the return value of the
call. (Bad code style! Better use a variable clearly defined for the
purpose, instead of reusing variables).<br>
- &quot;OldId&quot;, which is now the return-value from &quot;WaitForSingleObject()&quot;,
gets compared against zero. So can &quot;WaitForSingleObject()&quot; return zero,
and what does zero mean in that case? The Delphi documentation does not
say, so a dig into WINDOWS.PAS searching for the documented return
symbols may tell us what zero means.<br>
- I find that the symbol &quot;WAIT_OBJECT_0&quot; has the constant value of zero,
so statement in &quot;RestoreAutoSaved&quot; would be better written as:<br>
        if (OldId = WAIT_OBJECT_0) then<br>
- Putting some of the stuff together:<br>
  CreateEvent(nil, false, TRUE, <a replaced TagAtom string>);<br>
Note the TRUE, according to the Delphi documentation, this sets the
event-semaphore into a Signaled-State. I then believe, that if
CreateEvent() did not succeed in creating the event-semaphore, the event
is Not Signaled, and therefore WaitForSingleObject() will not return
WAIT_OBJECT_0.<br>
- This could mean that there is another QuArK instance running at the
same time, and therefore the auto-save file is not due to a crashed
QuArK, as it is still running.<br>
</p><p>- Note also, that any events owned by a process, the one who called
CreateEvent(), gets automatically released/closed by the
operation-system when that process stops/crashes. Thats why Armin never
did nor should do a CloseHandle() on the last CreateEvent(), as it will
destroy the purpose of the WaitForSingleObject() check.
</p><p>Phew... that was a bit much, for such a little thing ;-)
</p><p>I know a bit about event/mutex-semaphores, as I use them at work these
days, porting an OS/2-application to Windows 2000 Advanced Server.

</p><p>Easy money!
</p><p>*******
</p><p>The User|Menu|CreatePopup Menu error appears to be noncrititical.  11 popup
menus are created when the map editor is started, and not properly deleted
on closure but operation of the map editor does not seem to create more of
these errors.  The menu creation code is run when the buttons in the button
panel are pressed, but the resulting menus are propely deleted.
</p><p>However, it would probably be good to attend to this someday, since these
popups, and one ordinary menu, are created and not deleted every time the
map editor is started, so if it's started once in a session you get 12
menu errors; twice, 24.
