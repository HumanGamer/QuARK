If you have a group selected in the tree view, you can specify different
behaviour for it.
</p><p><i>Group is visible</i>&nbsp;. This is the normal setting. All objects that belongs
to this group, are visible and selectable on the map-views.
</p><p><i>Group is grayed out</i>&nbsp;. When this is marked, all objects that belongs to
this group, are shaded even if they are within the visible part of the
map-views.
</p><p><i>Group is hidden</i>&nbsp;. Every object that belongs to this group, are not drawn
on the map-views. Marking this option will automatically also check the
<i>Cannot select with the mouse</i>&nbsp; option.
</p><p><i>Hide on textured views</i>&nbsp;. When this option are checked, all objects
belonging to this group are not shown on solid-, textured- or 3D-views, only
wireframe-views. This speeds up drawing a bit.
</p><p><i>Cannot select with the mouse</i>&nbsp;. Check this option, if you do not want to
select and change objects belonging to this group by an accident. This is a
good setting, when you are done with some part of your map, and starts to build
something else near or within that finished part.
</p><p><i>Ignore to build maps</i>&nbsp;. If this option is checked and the <i>Ignore groups
marked so when building map</i>&nbsp; in the option menu also is checked, QuArK will
not include objects belonging to this group, when you build your level. Using
this option, you can play-test parts of your level, without having to

</p><p><i>Holes in map</i>&nbsp;. This function will try to check your map for <a href="glossary.html#l">leaks</a> also known as Holes. A map must not contain any hole, that is, there must be no path from 'inside' to 'outside' the map. All entities must be completely enclosed by polyhedrons. With this command, QuArK will search for such holes, and if it finds one, it displays an arrow that starts from an entity and goes outside through a hole or a gap. Generally, the end of the arrow is exactly in the hole. Note that the path found by QuArK is maybe not the most direct way to reach the hole, and there are maybe other holes in your map. It is not a accurate leak/hole finder, so sometimes it might point to a leak
which isn't there.

<i>Insert map item.</i>&nbsp; Activating this, will open the New map items window.
</p><p><i>Tricky force to grid.</i>&nbsp; Repairs maps that are off-the-grid.
</p><p><i>Tag side.</i>&nbsp; This menuitem are created by a <a href="glossary.html#p">plug-in</a>. It allows you
to select, or tag as it says, a <a href="glossary.html#f">face</a> of an polyhedron. With a
tagged-face, the next three menuitems becomes active. See <a href="maped.plugins.tagside.html#basic">'Basic Tag and Glue'</a> for detail on how to use this function.
</p><p><i>Clear tag.</i>&nbsp; Removes the tag.
</p><p><i>Glue to tagged.</i>&nbsp; Another selected face or polyhedron, can be glued to the
tagged face. Very usefull if you want another face to touch the tagged-face, so
it will be somewhat seamless.
</p><p><i>Wrap texture from tagged.</i>&nbsp; Should be enabled when the selected face is
next to the tagged one, and should wrap the texture from the tagged onto
the selection, with a fluent seam.
</p><p><i>Add to tagged.</i>&nbsp; Should be enabled when there is a tagged face, and
other face is selected; adds the selected face to the collection of tagged
ones.
</p><p><i>Link selected.</i>&nbsp; To use this one, you first need to create a multiple
selection of faces all occupying the same plane.  This can be
done with the 'Extend Selection from Face' from the
<a href="intro.mapeditor.menu.html#selectionmenu">'Selection menu'</a> below, or, if you have made
a list of tagged faces, with the 'Select Tagged' item from the same
menu.  What the Link selection command then does is 'link' all of the
selected faces so that if one is moved, you will be invited to move all the
others with it.
</p><p><a name="orientation"></a>
<i>Orientation.</i>&nbsp; Only active when you have selected a <a href="glossary.html#f">face</a>. It will
bring up a window where you can edit some attributes about that face. However,
its not recommended that you do it this way, unless you know what you're doing!
</p><p><i>Adjust angle.</i>&nbsp; Only active when you have selected a face. This will bring
the angle of the face on the polyhedron, to the nearest angle by which you
specified in the <a href="intro.configuration.map.html#building">'Building'</a>.
</p><p><i>Delete face.</i>&nbsp; As it says. However, deleting a face will very likely make
a polyhedron invalid.
</p><p><i>Cone over face.</i>&nbsp; This will create a new set of faces in style as a cone,
over the selected face. The number of new faces will be the number of
<a href="glossary.html#e">edges</a> the selected face has.
</p><p><i>Swap face sides.</i>&nbsp; Will swap the face inside-out. Do not use this, unless
you really want to!
</p><p><i>Look At.</i>&nbsp; An open 3D view shifts to look at this face head on. (SHIFT to look at the face from the back)
</p><p><a name="brushsubtraction"></a>
<i>Brush subtraction.</i>&nbsp; This function will subtract one <a href="glossary.html#b">brush</a> from another;<br>
- first select the brush you want the subtraction to occur on,<br>
- next select the brush that should be subtracted from the first.<br>
Then you activate this menu item, or press the accellerator key <b>CTRL+B</b>.
<br>Brush subtraction is the process of 'digging' a hole with the shape of a given polyhedron.Design a polyhedron with the shape of the hole, move it at the location where you expect a hole (that is, it must overlap at least one other polyhedron), and select this command. The polyhedrons that overlap this one will be 'digged'. If necessary, you can then remove the hole-shaped polyhedron. Note that all polyhedrons are always convex : this means that the polyhedrons you are digging into will usually be broken into several smaller pieces, each convex. To prevent these extra polyhedrons to make your map too complex, use a Negative polyhedron (a button bottom left after you selected a polyhedron), or a Digger (from the New Items window). There are other features that also lets you make holes; the most useful is probably the polyhedron cutter (button 'cut polyhedrons in two', top). If you select several polyhedrons, the last one subtracts in the other ones only (instead of in the whole world). You can use a group instead of a polyhedron as the subtracter.
</p><p><a name="facesharesubtract"></a>
<i>Face sharing subtraction.</i>&nbsp; This is an advanced brush subtraction method.
If a <a href="glossary.html#f">face</a> from the originally brush, will be split up into multiple
faces by the subtraction, it will actually be converted into a face, which is
shared by the brushes that will be created by the brush-subtraction. Read more
about <a href="maped.tutorial.advanced.html#facesharing">'Face Sharing'</a>.
</p><p><i>Extrude walls.</i>&nbsp; This extrudes walls from the faces, deletes the poly(s).
</p><p><i>Make hollow.</i>&nbsp; This will create a polyhedron for each face the selection has,
and delete the original selected polyhedrons. The inflate/deflate value in the
Movement configuration window, determines the thickness of the new polyhedrons,
and if they should occupy (negative value) or surround (positive value) the
original selected polyhedrons.
</p><p><i>Intersection.</i>&nbsp; This is basically a kind of <i>brush adding</i>&nbsp; function.
It will try to create a new polyhedron which occupy the common area of the
selected polyhedrons.
</p><p><a name="disdupimages"></a>
<i>Dissociate Duplicator images.</i>&nbsp; Only active when you have marked a
duplicator. This will create actual copies of the duplicator-object(s), and
remove the duplicator itself.
</p><p><i>Reset Texture Cycle.</i>&nbsp; Reload files specifying texture cycles for duplicators.
</p><p><i>Export texture-names.</i>&nbsp; Exports a list of used textures in this map, to a text-file.
</p><p><i>Integralize Selected Faces.</i>&nbsp; If faces without integral threepoints have enough integral vertices to be used as threepoints, changes the face to use them (also forces nearly integral ones). Selects the ones it changes, for checking. Use Find Non-integral Faces on the search menu to find suitable victims. Research and fix the remaining ones by hand.
</p><p><a name="heapstatus"></a>
<i>HeapStatus.</i>&nbsp; This item only shows on the menu if <a href="intro.mapeditor.menu.html#developermode">Developer Mode</a> is activated on the 'Options' menu, shown below in that section. This function is used to display heap information which tracks changes in memory used by this program.
</p><p><a name="makeprism"></a>
<i>Make Prism.</i>&nbsp; This opens a dialog window for your input to create a prism of various types as well as texture selection.
</p>
<p><i>Make X-Tree.</i>&nbsp; This is a simple 'tree' maker that allows you to select you texture, number of 'wings' and the scale size.
</p><p><i>Swap Selection.</i>&nbsp; Swap first and second elements of 2 selected items.
</p><p><i>Align selected.</i>&nbsp; Align items in selection along their bounding box edges, or along the edges of a marked object (RMB I Navigate Tree I <item> \ Mark).
</p><p><a name="reload"></a>
<i>Reload.</i>&nbsp; This item only shows on the menu if <a href="intro.mapeditor.menu.html#developermode">Developer Mode</a> is activated on the 'Options' menu, shown below in that section. When working on developing a plugin you can use this function to reload that plugin, or any other, without having to shut down and restart QuArK. However, in some cases this function is not always effective.

</p><p><i>Add menu item:</i>&nbsp; This will add a 3rd party program to the menu. Using the 'Add Item Dialog' window, select a category to place your menu items under and then find the program you want to add with the 'select program' file browser '...' button to the right of the input box. You can either leave the output/input default file at its current setting and point the programs output to it or use the 'File Browser' button ... to select another map file and location to use. Once the program items are added, you will be given a notice as such and to restart QuArk to complete the process of adding the items to your menu. You can add as many items to your menu as you like before restarting QuArk. Each program added will have two items (with the programs name) and a separation line to isolate them for easy recognition, as well as F1 popup windows to remind you where the program and import files are located on your hard drive. The first item starts the program. Once you have exported its finished product to the default map file, then use the second item to import the map file into the QuArk editor. The entire product will be added to the map you are currently working on as a separate group item. Although the 'worldspawn' entity will NOT be imported, other entities can be and may require you to delete them, like another 'info_player_start' for example. Because these ARE 3rd party programs, QuArK does not provide any documentation on their use and makes no warranty for them.
</p><p><i>Remove menu items:</i>&nbsp; Use this function to remove the desired custom menu items that have been added.
</p><p><i>Shape programs:</i>&nbsp;  These are programs that can make different shapes to use in your maps. One that I recommend is 'MGS-object builder' and can be downloaded from the  <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/quark/files/">Yahoo Quark group site</a>. If you find any programs that may help others, please let us know by making a posting to the <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/quark/">Quark groups site</a>.
</p><p><i>Terrain programs:</i>&nbsp;  This category is for your terrain programs for making landscape layouts in your maps. One that I recommend is <a href="http://countermap.counter-strike.net/Nemesis/index.php?p=1"> 'Terrain Generator'</a> and can be downloaded from its own site.
</p><p><i>Other programs:</i>&nbsp;  This category is for all other types of programs that can export to a map file for your use in QuArk.
</p><p><i>Import any map file:</i>&nbsp; This item function allows you to load any map file into the existing editor to be added to the map you are working on. Because it also may import entities, you may half to delete some of them like its info_player_start. This function is created by the plugins/map1loadanymap.py file.

</p><p><i>Cancel Selections.</i>&nbsp; (or by pressing its HotKey) Will unselect all objects that are currently selected, even frozen ones, and you are sent back to the 1st page, the treeview, if you are not already there.
</p><p><i>Make Detail.</i>&nbsp; (or by pressing its HotKeys) Will set the texture flag for the selected items to 'detail' so as to be ignored during the bsp file build to reduce the size of that game file. You can select any poly, face, side or combinaition. Once you have selected them hold the Alt key and press the D key to set all of their detail flags to active. If you still have them selected and press the Alt+D keys a second time, it will deactivate their detail flags, making it a toggle switch type function. Also, if you have a brush with just one or two faces already set for detail then by selecting the brush and using the Alt+D hot key, it will invert their settings. The detail face(s) will become inactive and all the others will be set to detail. 
</p><p><i>Select parent.</i>&nbsp; If something is selected, switches the selection to
that thing's parent in the map structure.  For example if a face is selected,
the selection will change to the face's parent brush (or group, if the face
is shared between the brushes of a group).
</p><p><i>Select child.</i>&nbsp; If something is selected, switches the selection to that
thing's first child.
</p><p><i>Select next/previous.</i>&nbsp; If something is selected, these commands
switch the selection to the next or previous sibling of that thing
in the tree-view.
</p><p><i>Freeze selection.</i>&nbsp;  Sometimes, when you are working on a brush
or a patch, it is annoyingly easy to loose the selection by accidently
clicking in the wrong place in the map.  This command 'freezes' the selection
so that that can't happen.  You can also freeze the selection by left-clicking
with the <Shift> key down.  Frozen selections can be changed in the treeview,
or by <Shift>-left-clicking, and can be removed &amp; unfrozen with <ESC>,
or just unfrozen with Unfreeze selection below.
</p><p><i>Unfreeze selection.</i>&nbsp;  If the selection is frozen, this command
unfreezes it, so that selection works by simple left-clicking again.
</p><p><i>Select tagged faces(s).</i>&nbsp;  If there are multiple tagged faces, this command
turns them into a multiple selection of those faces (which can be dragged
together, or manipulated in other ways).
</p><p><a name="invertface"></a>
<i>Invert face selection.</i>&nbsp; If a face or faces are selected, this changes
the selection to the currently non-selected faces in the same brush(es).
</p><p><i>Extend selection from face.</i>&nbsp; If a face is selected, this extends
the selection to all faces (of other brushes) that adjoin this face and
occupy the same plane.  Useful for moving large collection of faces
together.
</p><p><i>Browse multiple selection.</i>&nbsp; If you have a multiple selection, this
creates a dialog from which you can choose individual elements of the
multiple selection to select and work on in turn.
</p><p><i>Unrestrict selection.</i>&nbsp; Reverses the effect of Restrict to Selection,
allowing editing of the whole map again.
</p><p><i>Restrict to selection.</i>&nbsp; This 'restricts' the map editor to working
only on what is selected (when the command is given).  Other material
will either disappear or be greyed out (depending on the grey/hide out
of view setting, or disappear entirely in the textured 3d views), and
can't be selected.
</p><p><i>Zoom to selection.</i>&nbsp; This zooms the map 2D views in to the selection(s). If there is a 3D view open, it will also look at or zoom to the selection(s) in that view as well. See 'Look and Zoom in 3D views' under the 'Options' menu for more detail on how it works with this function.
</p><p><i>Mark selection.</i>&nbsp; Marking is a preliminary for the `Reorganize Tree' operations, which help to (re)organize the group-structure in the tree-view. For example you can mark a group, and then later insert a selected entity into it, or mark an entity, and later insert it into or over (in the treeview) the selected group. Reorganize Tree operations that can't be applied sensibly to the selected and marked objects are supposed to be greyed out; if they aren't it's a bug.
</p><p><i>Clear Mark.</i>&nbsp; This cancels the Mark selection.

<i>Menu Overview</i>&nbsp; The commands in this menu lets you run your map with the game. The most common commands are the first few ones, which lets you try your map as a one-step operation.
Before a map can be played, it must be compiled (translated into a .bsp file). This is done by other programs that QuArK will call for you. See the Configuration dialog box, under the page of the game you wish to map for, where you must tell QuArK where these build programs are installed. The programs themselves are available in Build Packs, one for each game you want to make maps for, and that can be downloaded from <a href="http://dynamic.gamespy.com/~quark/">http://dynamic.gamespy.com/~quark/</a>. 
</p><p><i>GO!</i>&nbsp; does the whole sheebang.
</p><p><i>QuickGO!</i>&nbsp; a faster version, which should only be used when testing your
map.
</p><p><i>Fastest (full bright)</i>&nbsp;, this is the fastest build for testing your map, but it will not show any lighting effects.
</p><p><i>Fastest on selection only</i>&nbsp;, same as 'Fastest' but only builds what you have selected.
</p><p><i>Prepare used textures</i>&nbsp; creates a <a href="glossary.html#fileext">.WAD</a> texture-file, with the
textures used in the map.
</p><p><i>Complete rebuild</i>&nbsp; will build everything, except running the FPS-game.
</p><p><i>Run FPS-game</i>&nbsp; starts the game with the current map.
</p><p>The next menuitems varies from FPS-game to FPS-game. Familiarize yourself with
these <a href="glossary.html#b">build tools</a>, for the FPS-game you're building a map to.
</p><p><i>Load Leak file</i>&nbsp; If you have a 'Leak' (hole) in your map you will see a <FONT COLOR="#FF0000">red line</FONT> running through the effected area and QuArK will generate a 'Point' file which creates this line. This feature allows you to reload that file to see the line again, as long as the map is not recompiled after the hole is fixed. If it is fixed and recommpiled, QuArK will eleminate the error which turns this function off.
</p><p><i>Load Portal file</i>&nbsp; This feature will show the 'Portals' of your map outlined with <FONT COLOR="#4184D7">blue lines</FONT>. What the blue lines indicate is the 'windows' between the convex ('leaf nodes') that the bsp process carves the visible spaces of your map into. So you can investigate the effects of using detail and hint-brushes, etc to make your map more efficient and run better. However if there was a 'Hole' in your map the last time it was compiled, this menu item will be turned off until the map is recompiled after the 'Hole' is fixed (see 'Load Leak file' above).
</p><p><i>Select Brush Number</i>&nbsp; Tries to find brushes by Entity and Brush number, as specified in the <a href="maped.builderrors.console.html#mixed_face">Python-console</a> compile tool error messages (the use of duplicators, etc. might subvert this).
</p><p><i>Customize menu</i>&nbsp; opens a window, in where you can add, change and remove
the above menuitems and their functionality.

<i>Grid scale in 2D views</i>&nbsp;. These functions allow you to display a scale and tick mark guides of the current grid setting in any one, combination, or all of the 2D views of the Editor, as shown in the top sub-menu. You can also center any one or combination of the scales for each view. If&nbsp;' All 2D views '&nbsp; or&nbsp;' all scales centered '&nbsp; is checked, it will deactivate this menu's individual items.
</p><p><i>Ruler guide in 2D views</i>&nbsp;. These functions allow you to display a line with the unit distance of total selected items in any one, combination, or all of the 2D views of the Editor. Much like the&nbsp;'Grid scale in 2D views'&nbsp; function above, this feature also has its own list of selections, as shown in the bottom sub-menu. If one of these sub-menu items is active, checked, then when ever a single <a href="glossary.html#f">face</a>, <a href="glossary.html#p">poly</a> or group of polys are selected a&nbsp;'Ruler'&nbsp; will be displayed above and/or beside them from the starting point to the end point of the selected items along with&nbsp;'0'&nbsp; at the starting point and the total amount of their distance at the end point.
</p><p><i>Delete unused faces &amp; polys</i>&nbsp;. If this is unchecked, you will be able to
make invalid polyhedrons/faces. Always keep this marked, so QuArK will warn
you, when you are going to make an invalid polyhedron/face.
</p><p><i>Secondary red lines</i>&nbsp;. When this is marked, an extra set of red lines will
appear in the map-views. These can be used to reduce the selection-area of one
map-view, if you do the selection in the other.
</p><p><i>3D Models in textured views</i>&nbsp;. Check this to see a 3D representation of
the entity-models, in textured views.
</p><p><i>Quantize angels</i>&nbsp;. When this is checked, adjusting any angle,
like a face-angle or entity-angle, it will automatically adjust it to the
nearest angle, specified in <a href="intro.configuration.map.html#building">'Building'</a>.
</p><p><i>Paste objects at screen center</i>&nbsp;. Check this if you want objects that you
paste into the map-view, appear in the center of the current map-view. Uncheck
it, and it will paste it at the exact position as the original.
</p><p><i>Ignore groups marked so when building map</i>&nbsp;. When this is marked, any group
marked <i>Ignore to build map</i>&nbsp; will not be available in the map when running
the FPS-game. Uncheck this if you want your entire map build.
</p><p><i>Negative polys really dig in 3D views</i>&nbsp;. If this option is off, negative polyhedrons are shown as normal polyhedrons in textured view so that you can easily edit them. When this option is on, digging is performed and you don't see the negative polyhedron at all, but only the hole it made.
</p><p><i>Default/Sticky/Axis-sticky texture</i>&nbsp;. In QuArK, the textures are attached to polyhedrons in such a way that they follow all its movements. However, for easier texture alignment, you can set these options that only apply when scrolling polyhedrons (not rotating nor zooming).
</p><p><i>Sticky textures</i>&nbsp;. The textures don't move when you look at it standing in front of the face.
</p><p><i>Axis-sticky textures</i>&nbsp;. The textures don't move when you look at it from the nearest axis direction. To mimic the way QuArK and most other Quake editors work, choose AXIS-STICKY.
</p><p><i>Don't center L-square</i>&nbsp;. If this item is on, threepoints aren't re-centered on face in texture positioning.
</p><p><i>Set Line Thickness</i>&nbsp;. This lets you set the thickness of certain lines that are drawn on the map, such as leak lines, portals, and targetting arrows.
</p><p><i>Rebuild 3D views</i>&nbsp;. This rebuilds the 3D views (actually all views) in case of a lockup. You may have to do this a few times to clear the views up. The easiest way is to just push the HotKey 'Tab' untill the views unlock and clear up.
</p><p><i>Axis XYZ letter indicator in view windows</i>&nbsp;. This display s the X Y or Z indicator letter per view to associate the rotation menu buttons. These are for reference only and are not selectable with the mouse.
</p><p><i>MultiSelect on Linked Drag</i>&nbsp;. When this option is checked, when a face is dragged that is linked to others, they all become the multi-selection after the drag. When it is unchecked, the selection remains unchanged.
</p><p><i>Link on Glue</i>&nbsp;. When this option is checked, the `Glue-to-tagged' command links the glued side to the tagged one, making it easy to keep them copanar.
</p><p><i>Silent Glue Linked on Drag</i>&nbsp;. When this option is checked, when something is dragged, faces linked to its faces will be dragged along too.
</p><p><i>Look and Zoom in 3D views</i>&nbsp;. If this menu item is checked, it will zoom in and center on the selection(s) in all of the 3D views when the 'Zoom to selection' button on the 'Selection Toolbar' is clicked. If a face is selected and the 'Shift' key is held down, it will look at the other side of the face and strive to center it in the view. If this menu item is unchecked, it will only look in the selection(s) direction from the current camera position.
</p><p><i>No Selection in Map Views</i>&nbsp;. When this menu item is checked, selection in the map views is prevented. This is useful when touring with the 3d viewer, to prevent selecting things accidentally.
</p><p><a name="developermode"></a>
<i>Developer Mode</i>&nbsp;. In this mode, two extra items appear on the 'Commands' menu, to help with debugging, etc. They are <a href="intro.mapeditor.menu.html#heapstatus">HeapStatus</a> and <a href="intro.mapeditor.menu.html#reload">Reload</a>. For more detail on them see the 'Commands' menu listing above.
</p><p><i>List of Plug-ins</i>&nbsp;. Opens a window which shows what plug-ins QuArK has
loaded.
