<p>This is of course the fundamental one.  For Q1/2 it's two 4-vectors, uaxis,uoffset;
vaxis, voffset, with this formula for computing the texture-coordinates
for a point in the map space (only points on the face being relevant,
of course):
<div class="doccode"><pre>
   u = x * u_axis.x + y * u_axis.y + z * u_axis.z + u_offset
   v = x * v_axis.x + y * v_axis.y + z * v_axis.z + v_offset

</p><p>With Q3 otoh, the texture-coordinates of each vertex of the face are
given, as a five-vector, along with the spatial coordinates (5-space
math, for L.M.Bujold fans!).  See
<a href=http://graphics.stanford.edu/~kekoa/q3/>  
Kekoa Proudfoot Unofficial Quake3 Map Specs</a>.  This representation
is rather redundant for brush-faces, but extends gracefully to patches.
</p><p>In QkBsphulls.pas there is code for converting both the Q1/2 and Q3 .bsp
representations to QuArK's.  A call of <strong>SolveForThreePoints</strong>
does the job for Q3; Q1/2 are handled by some equation-solving code
directly above that.

<p>The 'Classic Quake' face format is three parenthesized 3-vectors to
specify three points defining the plane, then the texture name,
and then five numbers being texture shift (2) rotation (1) and scale (2).
E.g.
<div class="doccode"><pre>
  ( 432 0 96 ) ( 432 128 96 ) ( 560 0 96 ) bricka2_2 -432 0 0 1 1 
</pre></div>
This is Quake; other games elaborate on this by putting various things
after the five numbers, such as in Q2/3 the three fields (Content, Flags,
Value) etc. (you can get an idea of the variations by studying the
WriteFace sub-procedure in QkMapPoly:TPolyhedron.SaveAsTextPolyhedron).
The way the five numbers work is that one imagines the texture as being
plastered onto whatever of the three axis-planes is closest to parallel
to the face, and then as being projected on the face, after being shifted,
rotated and scaled as specified by the numbers.
</p><p>This scheme has its advantages and disadvantages, which we will not go into
here, but another question is why use nine numbers to specify a plane when four
can actually do it? (three to specify a direction that the plane is
perpendicular to, a fourth to specify the distance from the origin that you go
in that direction to get to the plane).  The answer I think is that by
using nine numbers you can specify a lot of different planes using only
integers, whereas a four-number scheme would involve one in the tricky
world of floating point and roundoff errors.
</p><p>Anyway, this texture positioning scheme has difficulties with certain kinds
of configurations, such as unpredictable results for faces making 45 degree
angles to the axes, amd also makes it difficult to cause textures to move
with faces when objects are shifted (since the textures are basically
connected with axis planes, and projected onto the faces). </p>

<p>So Armin came
up with a different idea, which was to use the three points to specify the
texture scale as well as the face plane.  The basic idea is that the first point
is the origin of the texture (lower left corner), the second point the lower
right corner (end of texture x/s axis), and the third point the upper left
(end of y/t axis).  So when you move the ends of the texture L around in the
face page, you're actually manipulating the threepoints.  But there are
three twists in this, and then a problem.
</p><p>Twist 1: due to the screwy way in which graphics are represented, sometimes
the sign of the third threepoint has to be flipped to get the right result
(Armin told me that even he had to check this empirically).
</p><p>Twist 2: to prevent the size of the texture itself from influencing the
distance between the threepoints, their location is normalized as if the
size of the texture was 128x128.  This is what is retrieved by the
TFace.GetThreePoints method, which is accessed in Python via
threepoints(0) and setthreepoints(tp,0).  To get the actual locations
of the texture upper-left and lower right-corners, use
TFace.Get/SetThreePointsUserTex, which correct for the texture scale
(EchelleTexture), and also for one more thing:
</p><p>Twist 3: Three numbers do indeed specify a plane, but for efficient computations
in working with brushes we want to do a bit more, which is to code what side
of the plane is going to be inside the brush and what outside of it.  Happily
there is a nice math operation which does this, the cross-product
(<a href="src.math.vectors.html#cross">'The Cross Product'</a>).  If <B>u</b> and <b>v</b> are vectors, then
<b>u x v</b> (which can be computed by a rather complicated procedure that's
invoked in QuArK Python by the '^' operation on vectors)
is a vector that is perpendicular to both <b>u</b> and <b>v</b>, and so
naturally adapted to point to the outside of the plane containing in which
<b>u</b> and <b>v</b> lie.  So the basic idea is that if p1, p2 and p3
are the threepoints of the face, then <b>(p2-p1) x (p3-p1)</b> points to the
outside of the face's poly.  This vector is called a 'normal', and when
build tools complain about bad normals, they have failed to compute a satisfactory
value for this cross-product, for some reason or other.
</p><p>So now what if we want to mirror-flip a texture so that the lower right
corner of the texture is to the left rather than the right of the origin
in the map (the L is a L-mirror-image not an all).  The result of this
is that the normal will point in the wrong direction, so the final twist is
the 'mirror bit', the face attribute 'm' that sometimes appears with the
value of '1'.  There's a useful math fact about cross products that:
<div class="doccode"><pre>
u x v = - (v x u)
</pre></div>
That is if we take the inputs to the cross product in the opposite order,
we get a normal pointing in the opposite direction.  So, when the mirror
bit is 1, then the texture scale is gotten by swapping p3 and p2 of the
actual threepoints.  This is what is done by the TFace.Get/SetThreePointsT
methods called by Get/SetThreePointsUserTex.
</p><p>So for the full QuArK 'enhanced texture positioning' scheme, the
face threepoints are used plus this additional information about
the mirror-bit, which is coded in QuArK maps as TX1 or TX2 right
after the games comment-delimiter, so the standard Quark etp version
of the face we started with is:
<div class="doccode"><pre>
  ( 432 0 96 ) ( 432 128 96 ) ( 560 0 96 ) bricka2_2 -432 0 0 1 1 //TX1
</pre></div>
So that's how it works.
</p><p>The problem is this: by coding the texture-scale information into the
threepoints, we are cast out of the Garden of Integers created for us by
John Carmack, into the floating point wilderness.  This is reflected in
the phenomenon whereby vertexes sometimes drift off the grid by a tiny
amount and can't be put back on.  I'm not convinced that this really causes
terrible things to happen, but mappers hate it so it must be fixed,
requiring a different representation of texture scale info.

<p>There are lots of possibilities, but the particular one I went with
is what I call 'QuArK tv6', since it's based on using six numbers as
the value of a 'tv' specific (texture vector) to specify the three
texture points in a coordinate system for the face plane (only six
rather than nine number needed because the plane is 2-dimensional).
One reason for doing this is that it's relatively easy to convert from
the six number representation to the nine number representation that's
expected by other parts of QuArK.  So if you look more closely
at TFace.GetThreePointsT, you'll see that if the tv specific is found,
then the 2-number point specifications in the face coordinate system
are transformed intto 3-number specifications in the map coordinate
system, whereas if no tv specific is found then the threepoints and
mirror bit are used (old representation).  TFace.GetThreePointsUserTex
(which is what Python .threepoints(2) calls) then just uses whatever
GetThreePointsT provides without caring where it comes from.
GetThreePointsUserTex also has an option to either keep the origin of the
texture coordinates roughly in the middle of the face, or not do this.
</p><p>So much for reading; setting the texture is done by SetThreePointsUserTex,
which handles the scaling.  this calls SetThreePointsEx, which checks
whether the texture threeoints actually manage to define a plane (taking
a cross-product, see below), returning true if they do and false if
they don't (I don't think we need this check anymore, but am leaving it in
for now, and then calls SetThreePointsT which now sets the tv spec,
coincidentally erasing the 'm' specific if this is present, since
we don't need it any more.  Unless of course we're writing the Quark etp
format, in which case TFace.SimulateEnhTex generates old-style
threepoint-and-mirror bit information.
</p><p>So one leftover question is how is the face coordinate system generated?
Basically by the same scheme as used in the brush-primitives representation
in GtkRadiant, implemented in the function GetAxisBase,
which basically amounts to finding a horizontal vector that lies in the
face, then taking the perpendicular to that that lies in the face.
In QuArK Python, the function quarkpy.qeditor.bestaxes does something
very similar, but the reason for using the GtkRadiant function here
is to be able to write the 'brush primitives' format consistently with
what the GtkRadiant tools expect.  To make a coordinate system we need
an origin as well as the axis vectors (see <a href="src.math.vectors.html">'Vectors'</a>
for more on the philosophy of vectors); for this we use the first of the
threepoints.
</p><p>So the new texture scheme is extremely incremental, in the sense that
a face is left in the old representation until its texture is dragged,
and then it changes to the new.  One reason for this is that that even
if there's some mistake it can't happen that somebody's total map will
be trashed, there can only be problems with the faces actually worked on.
The downside is a certain amount of cruft, perhaps someday this could be
eliminated.
</p><p>A final point is that there is are methods TFace.SetThreePointsEnhEx and
TFace.RevertToEnhTex, callable from Python by enhrevert, just in case.
</p><p>The last thing that had to be done to make the new scheme work properly was
in the TFace.Deplacement method. which applies linear transformations to
faces, where the code setting the mirror bit is removed, since it is no
longer necessary.  The first version of the new scheme had a problem in
that I didn't check for the InverseOrientation property (the linear mapping
mirror-flips things), so that the brushes all got turned inside out).</p>

<p>'Brush primitives' is the new brush format used by GtkRadiant.
Other than some extra braces and a 'Brushdef' in the text of the format,
its main new feature (for now at any rate) is an improved method of
expressing the texture-mapping over the 5 'shift scale rotate'
numbers that come after the texture name in the old
representation.
</p><p>In BP format, you get something that looks like this coming
after the threeponts info, and before the texture name:
<div class="doccode"><pre>
( ( 0.007813 0 0 ) ( 0 0.007813 0 ) )
</pre></div>
What these are is the top two rows of the 'homogeneous matrix'
mapping the plane of the face, under a special coordinate system
we will get to in a moment, into the texture plane (so it's sort
of the reverse of how QuArK etp and tv6 work, since these most directly
represent the mapping from the texture plane onto the face).
Erm, what's a homogeneous matrix you might ask.
</p><p>It is 3x3 matrix whose bottom row is (0 0 1).  If you multiply
a homogeneous matrix by a column vector whose z coordinate is
1, 
you'll see that the equations are exactly those for a
linear mapping followed by a translation: the first two numbers
of the top two rows give a 2x2 matrix describing the linear
transformation, and the last number give a column vector to
be added (to the a column 2-vector) to give the translation.
So what about this coordinate system?
</p><p>It is one whose axis directions are gotten by rotating the
Y and Z coordinates of map space so that they lie in the
plane.  These direction vectors are computed by function
GetAxisBase in QkMapPoly.pas.  It's essential that q3map
and the editor compute them in the same way; hopefully the
GtkRadiant/Q3map developers won't change it without telling us.
Then of course for a coordinate system you need an origin,
this is gotten by scaling the face's normal vector by its
Dist (-ance from the origin).
</p><p>So what goes on in GetPXPY is that the (texture-scaled,
etc.) threepoints are converted to the Axis Base coordinate
system, and then these equations are solved for the
coefficients aij making up the matrix (I used Maple V
to get the solution):
<div class="doccode"><pre>
 a11*p0x+a12*p0y+a13 =  0
 a21*p0x+a22*p0y+a23 =  0

 a11*p1x+a12*p1y+a13 =  1
 a21*p1x+a22*p1y+a23 =  0

 a11*p2x+a12*p2y+a13 =  0
 a21*p2x+a22*p2y+a23 = -1
</pre></div>
</p><p>The conversions from Brush Primitives to QuArK (once etp, now tv6) are
made in the procedure ReadQ3BrushDef in QkMap.pas.</p>

uses texture-scale representation that is quite close to that
used by the Q1/2 bsp.  After the texture name come 2
square-bracketted 4-tuples, then 0, and then 2 more numbers.
The first three members of the 4-tuples are basically the u

while the last member is the offset.  Then the following 0
is empty cruft (originally indicated rotation), while the
last two numbers as uscale and vscale, but you divide the
u and v axes by them rather than multiply to get the .bsp
structure (so it's opposite to what a sensible person would
expect).  I.e.
<div class="doccode"><pre>
 WC3.3: [u.x     u.y     u.z     u.o] [v.x v.y v.z v.o] 0 u.s v.s
