If you plan on using anyone of the below mentioned macro-objects; Digger,
Negative brush, Duplicator, Copy-One or Mirror, you must use groups!
</p><p>Since a macro-object apply its effects/actions to the group it is
positioned in, and all of its sub-groups, it will be impossible to use
the objects, if you don't use groups.
</p><p>Another good point for using groups is, that this will allow you to move many
brushes and entities, in just one movement. Just select the group of objects
you want to move, and move them in the 2D-views.
</p><p>At the moment, it is not possible in QuArK to lock brushes/entities in a
group, so when you select a brush/entity in the 2D-view which belongs to the
group, the entire group is selected instead. To do this, you have to first
select the group in the tree-view, and then move it in the 2D-views, or use
the <a href="maped.plugins.madsel.html#extend">'Extend Selection'</a> functionality.
</p><p></td></tr>

</p><p><img width=180 height=130 align=right src="maped.tutorial.advanced.image34.png">
With groups, you can also hide their contents from the 2D-views, or just gray
it out. To do this, select the group in the tree-view, right-click to get its
context-menu up, and select between:
</p><p><ul>
<li>Group is visible
<li>Group is grayed out
<li>Group is hidden
</ul>
</p><p>Notice that the last option, will also automatically select &quot;Hide on textured
views&quot; and &quot;Cannot select with the mouse&quot;. This way you won't accidently select
parts of your map, that you can't currently see in the 2D-views.

If you think, that to create a hole in a brush, you have to brush-subtract
(carve), then think again when using QuArK!
</p><p>A very powerful feature in QuArK,
is the ability to use diggers and negative polys, which first does the real
brush-subtraction when you compile your map. This lets you experiment placing a
hole if you're not quite sure about its position, without messing with
brush-subtraction and more brushes than necessary.
</p><p>A digger and negative poly will only create holes in brushes of the

The texture of a face on a digger or negative poly, will be applied to the
brush that is carved, but only if that brush hasn't already been carved
or cut at that coplanar plane that the face of the digger/negative poly will
carve/cut it at. This can get tricky at times, and depends on which
digger/negative poly does the first carving/cut.
</p><p>Example: In the image to the right, there are two negative polys both with
different textures (RED, BLUE), and two normal brushes.
</p><p>After the negative polys have done their job (during compile), it may look like
this in the game:
</p><p><ul>
<li>The cut-lines <b>1</b>, <b>3</b> and <b>C</b> will get their texture from
    the negative polys' faces.
<li>The cut-line <b>A</b> will keep its texture, because it was already
    <i>cut</i>&nbsp; beforehand.
<li>The cut-lines <b>2</b> and <b>B</b> will get their textures from the
    negative poly who <u>first</u> does the carving/cut. In this case, the face
    <b>B12</b> became RED and face <b>B23</b> became BLUE, but face <b>2AB</b>
    is still RED.

Say you wanted to make a staircase, with 20+ stairsteps. The dull method is to
create a brush which is the first step, and then copy-paste-move it so you'll
end up with 20+ brushes. Now imagine that you made an error, or found a new
texture that'll look better - you would have to start all over.
</p><p>Not so with QuArK! With a duplicator macro-object, you can create a
master-stairstep, and let the duplicator automatically do the copy-paste-moving
for you. Every change you make to the master, will instantaneously be
duplicated.
</p><p>Again, to use this duplicator properly, you must
<a href="maped.tutorial.advanced.html#grouptechniques">'use groups'</a>!
</p><p><b>Note</b> that when duplicating, by default everything is duplicated, including
anytargetname/target specifics any entities have. If you need to have different
targetname/target in the copies, you should check whether the 
incrementable specifics described in <a href="maped.duplicators.basic.html#increment">'Incrementing Specifics'</a>,
or the <a href="maped.plugins.argreplacer.html">'Arg Replacer'</a> plugin,

    E.q. staircases or a row of columns.

In the image to the right, multiple things are shown:
</p><p><ul>
<li>You must put your master-objects within the same group as the
    Duplicator macro-object. In this example, only one 'new cube'-brush is our
    master, but any number of brushes and entities can be put in here.
<li>Whenever the Duplicator is selected, the 2D-views will display a series of
    Duplicator-copy Handles. These are used to control the spacing and
    direction, between each copy. It can also be altered with the offset
    specific.
<li>The count specific of the Duplicator, controls how many copies the
    duplicator must make.
</ul>
</p><p>The (New) Copy-One and Mirror macro-objects work similarly to the enhanced
duplicator, but they are specialized to only make one copy.
</p><p><ul>
<li>Copy-One will create a copy of your master-objects, and allow you to place
    the copy somewhere else. New Copy-One has additional features making it
    more suitable for making multiple copies with irregular spacing.
<li>Mirror &lt;an axis&gt; creates a copy of your master-objects, and mirror
    them along the axis specified, at the origin of the Mirror macro-object in
    the 2D-view.
</ul>
</p><p>It is possible to put a duplicator macro-object, into a sub-group of another
duplicator, and so on. This way, you can, for instance, create multiple lines
of a row of columns on many floors.  See <a href="maped.duplicators.html">'Advanced Duplicators'</a> for more
details, and additional types of duplicator.

<p>QuArK supports the advanced feature of &quot;sharing&quot; a face among several
polyhedrons (NOTE: the term &quot;polyhedron&quot; and &quot;brush&quot; are interchangeable.  Many
editors use the term &quot;brush&quot; while QuArK uses &quot;polyhedron&quot; or simply &quot;a poly&quot;).
</p><p>Please note that face sharing requires the use of &quot;groups&quot;.  If you don't know
how to use QuArK's group feature, you need to
<a href="maped.tutorial.advanced.html#grouptechniques">'review the basics'</a>.  Before we get into face
sharing, we also need to review some Quake-engine basics.
</p><p><u>Defining a world...</u>
</p><p>Quake-engine based games are comprised of polys.  To define a poly, you need to
define a number of planes.  As we all remember from geometry, a plane is
a flat, 2-dimensional object that has infinte length and width.
</p><p>A poly in Quake is the intersection of a bunch of planes.  A simple cube is
defined by the intersection of six planes.  Two planes define the top and
bottom of the cube while four more planes define the four sides.  Imagine a
house of cards.  A single &quot;room&quot; of this house would consist of one card face
down on the table, four cards for each side and one card on top.  Now imagine
these cards as planes.  The inside of this &quot;room&quot; (the place where all six of
the planes intersect) creates a poly.
</p><p>QuArK gives you individual access to the planes, or &quot;faces&quot;, that define a
poly. As we all know, you place textures on these faces to build your level.
What you can also do is &quot;share&quot; a face among multiple polys.  If two (or more)
polys share the same face, you define the texture scaling and position once on
that shared face and every poly using that face will have a smooth texture
flow.
</p><p><u>Putting Face Sharing to work</u>
</p><p>Imagine 3 polys in a row (part of a room).  The middle one is the same height
as the ones to the left and right, but it's bottom is raised up. It's an entry
way into a hallway.  Here's the view if you're facing the 3 walls:
</p><p><center><img  src="maped.tutorial.advanced.front.png"></center>
</p><p>Assume we use the same texture for the &quot;front&quot; of these polys (the side that is
facing us), we'll have to position the texture on the second and third polys
very carefully so it flows nicely across the entire wall.  Looking at the 3
polys from above, we'd see:
</p><p><center><img  src="maped.tutorial.advanced.top1.png"></center>
</p><p>All 3 of these polys share 2 planes.  If we look at the above view the &quot;front&quot;
and &quot;back&quot; faces of all 3 polys run along the same plane:
</p><p><center><img  src="maped.tutorial.advanced.top2.png"></center>
</p><p>To keep things simple, we'll just worry about the &quot;front&quot; plane.
</p><p>Create a new group.  We'll call the group &quot;Wall1&quot; and move all 3 polys into the
group.  Your treeview should look something like this:
</p><p><center><img border=1 src="maped.tutorial.advanced.tree1.png"></center>
</p><p>Now open up the first poly to show all of the faces and move the &quot;front&quot; face
to the top of the group (determing the face to move is easiest by just
selecting it in the editor).  You move the face by grabbing it with a
right-click and dragging it to the top of the group (outside the poly).  We'll
assume the face to move is the one QuArK calls &quot;south&quot;.  After moving the
&quot;south&quot; face, your treeview should now look something like this:
</p><p><center><img border=1 src="maped.tutorial.advanced.tree2.png"></center>
</p><p>Now open up the face list of the second and third poly's and delete the front
face of each of those -- this will <i>usually</i>&nbsp; be the same face (i.e.
&quot;south&quot;) as the first one, but not always.  Select the face in the editor to be
sure.
</p><p>The &quot;south&quot; face is now the &quot;front&quot; face that all of the three polys share.
Define your texture for that face and you're all set!  No problems with texture
alignment because it's one face -- the texture is just pasted across the entire
face!
</p><p><center><img  src="maped.tutorial.advanced.facesharing.png"></center>
</p><p>This technique is also handy if you have a floor that is composed of multiple
polys (because of the shape of the room -- non-convex).  Assuming all of these
polys are at the same height, put all of them in a group and share the side
facing &quot;up&quot;.  Now when you want change the floor texture, change it on the one
floor face and the entire floor (across all of the polys) changes since they're
all sharing that face (plane).
