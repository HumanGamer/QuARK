Although a more 'Game Specific' (Quake 2) function, this particular menu item will lead you to a very powerful
and useful tool that deals with the entering and handling of game bots.
</p>
<p>This menu items actual function is to paste a bot waypoint, a position point to control a bots movement through
a map, into the map.
</p><p>To paste a bot waypoint, you must first have copied (CTRL+C) a single 'dup botwaypointerpoint' entity
into the clipboard.
</p><p>This action also creates a new targetname for the waypoint, and keeps it aligned with the previous
waypoint selected.
</p><p>Creating 'bot' type maps is supported with the installation and use of a special editor which is covered
in detail on its registering with QuArK, its functional applications and use in its own section of the
Infobase docs called the
<a href="maped.plugins.botwaypointer.html">Bot Waypoint Editor</a>.
</p><p>To the right and below we are showing a 'screen shot' listing of the QuArK Configuration area that
handles this installation and registering step for QuArK.
</p><p>For a quick and brief run down of these steps, go to QuArK's Configuration Games section and select Quake 2.
</p><p>Click the 'Add-ons...' icon button to open the 'Game Configuration' window and click on its 'Add...' button.
</p><p>The 'Add...' window will open and show a listing of all available .qrk file addons. From that list select the
BotWaypointer.qrk addon and click the 'Ok' icon button to register it.
</p><p>You can now close all the open windows and proceed to the section below.
</p><p>This is also covered in the <a href="maped.plugins.botwaypointer.html">Bot Waypoint Editor</a> section
with a more descriptive tutorial for its setup and use.

clicked on last. The default value is 0 0 0, or the center of the view grid. This can be changed to
position the image to exactly where you need it and it will remain at that same location as you zoom or pan in the view.
</p><p><b>Scale</b>: The size of the image can also be set to a proper scale that will fit your needs,
1 is its full image size.
</p><p><b>Poly No Fill</b>: As shown in the view shot to the right, a selected poly is normally filled solid with
a predefined color (lower part shown), in this case blue. However, when working with a background image, this will
block out the image making it very hard to work with. The 'Poly No Fill', when checked, removes this fill
color (upper part shown) allowing the image to be seen. This can also be changed in the
<a href="intro.configuration.map.html#options">Map Options</a>
configuration section.
</p><p><b>Color Guide</b>: When the 'Poly No Fill' option is used the selected polys outline shape only is drawn.
But because each image has a contrasting color that shows up better, the 'Color Guide' lets you select
the color that works best for you. This can also be changed in the
<a href="intro.configuration.map.html#colors">Map Colors</a> configuration section.
</p><p><b>Apply and view changes</b>: This button 'activates' the above changes and selections, but it will
NOT close the dialog box, so you can see how the image appears in the 2D view and make any necessary
adjustments or select another image to use instead.
</p><p><b>Remove background image</b>: To remove a background image after you have finished with it, simply
<a href="glossary.html#r">RMB</a> click in an unused section of the map select 'Background image' and then click this button.
</p><p><b>Close this dialog</b>: does exactly that. Any changes or selection that have not been activated by
the 'Apply and view changes' button above will not take effect and any currently set items will remain
in effect.

a standard system menu that can be used to 'Preview' an image before you actually select it for the editor.
You can also 'Rename', copy and even 'Delete' it if you wish.
</p><p>These are very effective and time efficient functions and we encourage their use.
