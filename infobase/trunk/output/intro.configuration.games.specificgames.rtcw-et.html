<p>In this short tutorial I will be showing you how to quickly setup Quark to compile and
run maps for the Return to Castle Wolfenstein - Enemy Territory or RTCW-ET game engine.
We have strived to preset its configuration as much as possible based on the games
standard installation settings.
</p><p><table border=0 cellspacing=0>
<tr><td valign=top align=left>
</p><p><b>Part 1 – Setting up QuArK to work with RTCW-ET</b>
</p><p>In this section we will quickly go over how to setup Quark to work with RTCW-ET.
To start with load up Quark, you should be greeted with the 'Quark Explorer' panel.
The Quark Explorer allows you to define which game environment you wish to work in,
as well as doing many other things.
</p><p>First we need to select the game we want to map for. We do this by simply going
to the 'Games' button located on the top right of the Explorer panel, once pressed it
will present you with a drop list of all the currently available games, select
RTCW-ET as shown in the screen shot to the right.
</p><p>Next we need to setup Quark to work with the RTCW-ET game engine, which is actually a variation
of the Quake 3 engine. To do so go back to the 'Games' button and press the 'Configuration'
button at the bottom of the list. 
</p><p>Once selected a new window will be opened called 'Configuration', making sure you have
RTCW-ET selected on the left navigation panel, (under the Games Tab) as we now need
to fill out some of the necessary game settings on the right of the Configuration panel which
is shown two images below.
</p><p>But before we do that, go to your <b>Wolfenstein - Enemy Territory</b> game folder and create a new
sub-folder named <b>QuArK files</b>. This is where the compiling program folder and its files will be placed.
You will need to download the <a href="http://quark.planetquake.gamespy.com/gamepaks.php3">q3map_2.5.16_win32_x86.zip</a>
file from the Official QuArK site.
</p><p>Also, see the <a href="intro.configuration.games.specificgames.rtcw-et.html#misc">Misc. Info.</a>
section below for more detailed instructions on its installation.

<b>Part 2 – QuArK game pack download</b>
</p><p>This is the QuArK RTCW-ET game support package. Download the <a href="http://quark.planetquake.gamespy.com/gamepaks.php3">QuArK_RTCW-ET.zip</a>
file and extract it, using the folders path option, to the game folder location where you have RTCW-ET installed on your computer.
</p><p>All the paths to the &quot;etmain&quot; sub-folder have already been set in the zip file.
The zip file is about 45.6 MB and will take around 1 minute with cable or DSL.
</p><p>This package has been created to work with QuArK 6.5.0 alpha 8 or later and will give the most complete
support available.
</p><p>Every effort has been made working through the RTCW-ET game files and other sources to allow the viewing
of all available textures in <a href="intro.texturebrowser.overview.html">QuArK's Texture Browser</a>,
all game models viewable in the 3D editor Texture views and detail entity settings with the use of
pre-defined dropdown list, model selection and variations list, file selection capabilities for models
and sounds, as well as 'color pickers' for all lighting functions. Even a few 'script\shader' corrections.

<b>Part 3 – QuArK RTCW-ET Configuration settings</b>
</p><p>As you can see in the image below, most of the settings have already been set with a default
entry. While others have been pre-coded in
QuArK's Defaults.qrk file that you can not see. This will prove to make life a lot easyer
when you go to build and run your maps in RTCW-ET.
</p><p><i><u>RTCW-ET command-line</u></i>&nbsp;: Even though this is pre-set for you, I wanted to explain
exactly what the added items are that follow the ET.EXE entry, the entire line is:
</p><p><ul>ET.EXE +set sv_cheats 1 +set sv_pure 0 +set g_gametype 2 +set fs_homepath etmain +set fs_game tmpQuArK +devmap &quot;%filename%&quot; +exec
</p><p><li><b>+set sv_cheats 1</b> lets you use the game console (by pressing the ~ Tilley key)
developer commands like /noclip, /god and /give all.
<li><b>+set sv_pure 0</b> this causes your map to be loaded directly into the game engine, bypassing all the normal startup movies.
<li><b>+set g_gametype 2</b> this tells the engine to accept your map as a developers game type 2 map and starts a local server for it to run.
<li><b>+set fs_homepath etmain</b> gives the path to the <b>etmain</b> game sub-folder in the RTCW-ET folder,
where the .pak files are.
<li><b>+set fs_game tmpQuArK</b> a second <b>tmpQuArK</b> sub-folder will be created in the above
<b>etmain</b> folder, this sets it as a mod folder.
<li><b>+devmap &quot;%filename%&quot;</b> this sets your map <b>%filename%</b>
(a variable that holds your map's name) as the map to load into the game.
<li><b>+exec</b> this executes these commands and starts the game engine.
</ul>
</p><p><i><u>Directory of RTCW-ET</u></i>&nbsp;: If this does not match your RTCW-ET folder location, use the <b>...</b> button to select your RTCW-ET folder.
</p><p><i><u>RTCW-ET CD_ROM drive</u></i>&nbsp;: This is the location of the game cd if you need to operate it from there, just click on the ... button to select the cd drive.
</p><p><i><u>Run these build-programs...</u></i>&nbsp;: This allows the display of the building, compiling, process in QuArK's console.
</p><p><i><u>Default directory of build-programs</u></i>&nbsp;: Does not need any settings here.
</p><p><i><u>Run tools from base directory</u></i>&nbsp;: Do not check this box unless you plan to put both build programs in the same folder and set its folder path above.
</p><p><i><u>Output Map Format</u></i>&nbsp;: The default setting for &quot;Brush Primitives&quot; should be correct here. If not there are other options you can choose from or just type in your own.
</p><p><i><u>1st through 4th program</u></i>&nbsp;: These are pretty self explanatory, just make sure the &quot;q3map2.exe&quot; is set to the correct path for you. If not just use the ... button to select the file.

</td></tr></table>
</p><p>After you have finished setting Quark to work with the RTCW-ET engine, simply hit the 'Apply'
button, and then press the 'OK' button to close the Configuration panel. This will put you
back in the Quark Explorer. Now is also a good time to close QuArK completely, this will
save your settings in the Setup.qrk file. You're done!
</p><p><b>Part 4 – Compiling</b>
</p><p>When you are ready to compile your map, simply select the &quot;Go ![textures+build+Rctw-ET]&quot;
main menu item, which is a &quot;Full&quot; build, meaning for, textures, their script files
and lighting. This will cause QuArK to export the map file to your RTCW-ET\tmpQuArK\maps
folder, texture files to the textures folder and script files to the scripts folder. If any of the
folders do not exist then QuArK will create them. Once that is done, QuArK will then start up the
build program to complete the process of compiling the map file and build the rest
of the files needed to run in RTCW-ET. Some of these additional game files will be placed in a second folder
with the same name &quot;tmpQuArK&quot; but that folder will be in the RTCW-ET &quot;etmain&quot; game directory folder.
Then the game will be started to load your map and display it !

</p><p><tr><td><br>
The rest of the RTCW-ET menu items are variations of the &quot;Full&quot; build process to expedite the compiling
and in game viewing time when a &quot;Full&quot; build is not needed.
</p><p>Because you have already completed the configuration steps above you will be able to see
your map in QuArK's Textured 3D view. Even that part is automatically done for you. Just
place your mouse cursor over that view, click your <a href="glossary.html#r">RMB</a> and select &quot;Textured&quot; from
the pop-up menu. Just a few more minor but important pointers in the
<a href="intro.configuration.games.specificgames.rtcw-et.html#misc">Misc. Info.</a>

There are various ways in QuArK to deal with sound editing by using .wav files. But because all
of these files are stored in the games .pak files, they can not be used directly in QuArK. So in
that case their path and full file name would need to be typed in where needed by hand.
This is not only cumbersome but leaves a lot of room for errors. Because of this, we have setup
&quot;sound file selectors&quot; where they are needed in the DataET.qrk file for various entities when
they use sound input settings. The only requirement to use this feature is that the &quot;sound&quot; folder
needs to be extracted from the games .pak files.
</p><p><b>Extracting .pak files &amp; their placement</b>
</p><p>The games .pak files are nothing more than a type of .zip compression file and can easily be accessed
to extract individual files or entire folders by either using <a href="http://www.WinZip.com/">WinZip</a>,
<a href="http://quark.planetquake.gamespy.com/downloads/pakscape-011.zip">PakScape v0.11</a> (my personal
favorite) or any other archive program.
</p><p>Once you have opened the .pak file, select the &quot;sound&quot; folder and drag it into your RTCW-ET &quot;etmain&quot; folder.
You can now go to that &quot;sound&quot; folder by simply clicking on the &quot;sound file selectors&quot; button that looks
like this ... and just select that sound.wav file that you want to use for any entity that has a selector.
</p><p><b>Custom Sounds and Functions</b>
</p><p>By having the &quot;sound&quot; folder extracted and placed, as described above, you can now place any .wav file
in that folder and select it for sound editing use. There is one important criteria though. The name of the
.wav file must NOT have any blank spaces in its name or it will not be located and played in the game.
You can, however, use lower dashes _ instead of spaces to separate words in its name.
</p><p>If you wish to distribute any custom sound files with your map, just create a .pak file
(using <a href="http://www.WinZip.com/">WinZip</a> or
<a href="http://quark.planetquake.gamespy.com/downloads/pakscape-011.zip">PakScape v0.11</a>) and place a folder
called &quot;sound&quot; in it with your custom.wav files located in that folder.
</p><p>When using a &quot;sound file selector&quot;, there are a couple of nice functions that are available to you by clicking
your <a href="glossary.html#r">RMB</a> while you have your mouse cursor over a particular .wav file. This will bring up a standard
system pop-up menu where you can select to either <b>Play</b> it before you actually select it (very handy), <b>Rename</b>
it, change it's <b>Properties</b> or even <b>Delete</b> it, among other things.
</p><p>Once a .wav file has been selected, QuArK will automatically trim its path and make other necessary changes
so that the sound will now play properly in the game.
</p><p><b>If a Sound Does Not Play</b>
</p><p>There is ONE exception to the rule here that I have found only with the &quot;worldspawn&quot; entity sound setting which will
NOT play when your map is first loaded into the game after a build sometimes. If that should be the case for ANY sound
file, the first thing you want to try is reloading your map while still in the game.
</p><p>To do this just press the <b>~</b> Tilde key to bring down the game console then type in <b>\map (your map name)</b>
 press <b>Enter</b> and it should solve the problem when your map reloads. If that does not work, then something else is
causing this issue such as improper format <b>Properties</b> of the .wav file itself, which you can check
by comparing those to another .wav file that does play and changing it to that type of format,
using the <a href="glossary.html#r">RMB</a> method I described above. That pretty well covers it for sound editing.

<b>Installing the q3map_2.5.16_win32_x86 build tool</b>
</p><p>When you install this program you will need to direct it to the
<a href="intro.configuration.games.specificgames.rtcw-et.html#config">QuArK files</a> folder as shown
earlier in the <a href="intro.configuration.games.specificgames.rtcw-et.html#config">Configuration section</a>.
That is really all you need to verify.
</p><p><b>Changing and re-running a map</b>
</p><p>Normally, I run RTCW-ET in a separate window, instead of its &quot;Full Screen&quot; mode when working on
a map, for a couple of reasons.<br>
First it's a lot easer to see around to view something in the
editor that you might be concentrating on with your work.<br>
The other is being able to jump back
and forth between the editor and the game running by simply holding down the Alt key and
pressing the Tab key to switch.<br>
It seems less confusing that way.
</p><p>Unfortunately it does not have the ability to make changes in your map while the game is still running
and then rebuild and reload the map.<br>
To do this you will need to close the game and go through the normal process once again.<br>
But basically all you need to do is just click the QuArK menu item and off you go.
</p><p>To close the game, press the Esc key and select &quot;Exit game&quot; from its menu.
</p><p><b>Custom textures or models not showing Textures</b>
</p><p>Extensive work has been done creating the QuArK_RTCW-ET.zip file to eliminate this problem.
However, if you should encounter this kind of issue, read this same section on the 
<a href="intro.configuration.games.specificgames.rtcw.html#misc">RTCW Configuration</a>
page as to what you should do.
</p><p><b>Texture Loading Game Error</b>
</p><p>Although this has not been found to be an issue with Enemy Territory, so far, it has come to our 
attention while working with <b>Return to Castle Wolfenstein</b> that there is at least
one texture in the original RTCW pak0.pk3 file (textures\common\blackish.jpg) that causes RTCW
to give an error in the game console that says:
</p><p>Error: LoadTGA: Only type 2 (RGB), 3 (gray), and 10 (RGB) TGA images supported
</p><p>and stops the game map from loading. If you should receive this game error message, read this same
section on the <a href="intro.configuration.games.specificgames.rtcw.html#misc">RTCW Configuration</a>
page as to what you should do.
</p>
<p><b>Other Comments</b>
</p><p>Some entities and\or models do not work properly or at all. These are erroneous items that were not
done correctly by other parties and is not a bug with QuArK. However, other entities may not have
been fully understood as to their proper needs and settings which could be an item to bring to our
attention for correction.
