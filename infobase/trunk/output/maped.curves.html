<p>A basic patch (there are also composite patches that we call 'quilts') can
be thought of as a squarish sheet of material stretched out by a 3x3 grid
of 9 'control points'.  To make one, start a basic map and click on the
patch icon in the user panel (labelled 'bezier'). You will then see a grid
of colored control points drop into the overhead view of the map:
</p><p><table width=100% cellspacing=0 cellpadding=0 border=0>
<tr><td align=middle>
<img  src="maped.curves.bez1.png">
</td><td align=middle>
<img  src="maped.curves.bez2.png">
</td></tr>
</table>
</p><p>The (here horizontal) lines of control points of the same hue are the rows,
the vertical ones are the columns.  The points get darker as you move along
the rows up from index zero.  If you leave the cursor
sitting over a control point for a while, a rather large
flyover hint appears, beginning with the control point's row
and column indexes, and giving rather extensive information about
stuff you can do.
</p><p>The black dot is a handle which can be used to move the whole patch, and
also has a few RMB (Right Menu Button) commands.
</p><p>Now the patch is 'anchored' at the corners, in the
sense that if you drag a corner point, the patch is pulled out
with it, but it is only 'attracted' by the non-corner points;
if one of them is dragged, the patch pulls out towards it,
but does not stay attached.  This effect also appears with
3-dimensional movement, as you can see by opening a 3d view
and playing around with it:

<tr><td align=middle>
<img  src="maped.curves.bez3.png">
</td><td align=middle>
<img  src="maped.curves.bez4.png">
</td></tr>
</table>
</p><p>If you play around with the patch and then run the map
in Quake3, you'll find that the patch displays a texture
on only one side, and also only blocks movement on that
side, an fact which could be used to make some rather
annoying effects in maps.
</p><p>There is quite a bit more to patches, as we will see
more of below, but direct patch
editing is slow and difficult, and not a good way to approach
basic tasks such as making archways and rounded corners.
For these purposes we instead use

<p>A basic patch has nine control points, arranged in 3 rows of 3
elements each.  Given essential limitations on what these
('quadratic bezier') patches can do, to make a full range of
shapes, you need multiple 3x3 patches.  A semi-decent approximation
to a circle for example needs at least four (although it's noticeably
squarish, and to make it rounder you'd need more).  Typically
lots of these patches will share edges, so it's natural to think
of 'quilts' of 3x3 patches, sharing edges.
</p><p>The Q3A engine provides direct support for such quilts, as long
as they are rectangular.  If you think about the math you'll
see that thanks to the edge sharing, a quilt of four patches
in a square will have 5x5 = 25 different control points, and
a strip of four patches that might be arranged in a row to be
wrapped around to make a columns will be a 3x9 quilt. And
that in these quilts, control points on odd-numbered rows/columns
will lie on (basic) patch edges, and if the point is in an
odd-numbered row <strong>and</strong> column it will be a patch
corner.
</p><p>In Q3Radiant documentation, quilts are called 'meshes', but there
are lots of different kinds of meshes, and these quilts, or
more precisely, quadratic quilts, have special properties,
so we'll call them quilts to distinguish them from whatever
amazing stuff might come next.
</p><p>Currently you can make quilts by RMB on a patch control point,
then <span class="act">'Thicken -&gt; Add Row/Column'</span>.  This has the effect of replacing
one row or column of patches with two (and so adding two additional
strips of control points).  Another way to make quilts is to dissociate
the images from one of the shapebuilders, such as column.  Playing
around with the quilts you can see the difference between the
odd and even numbered rows and colums.  The column for example has
a square of control points with the odd-numbered ones in the
middle of the sides and the evens at the corners; if this were
reversed the shape would be a rectangular rather than a rounded
column.
</p><p>QuArK definitely needs more elaborate facilities for creating and
shaping quilts, hopefully these will develop over time.

<p>There are currently three basic ways of manipulating textures
on patches, dragging, a dialog box, and projection.  For
dragging, drag on a point with the 'S' key depressed.  Not
much will seem to happen, but when you stop dragging,
the texture will be 'pulled' in the direction you dragged.
</p><p>If you drag again and look closely in the message window at
the bottom left of the screen while dragging, you'll see
numbers, these are the texture coordinates of the point.
In patches &amp; quilts, texture coordinates are 'OpenGL style';
one corner of the basic texture tile is (0,0), the opposite
(1,1).  Note that a patch where the far corner is (2,2), and the
other coordinates correspondingly doubled, will have the texture
scale <strong>reduced by half</strong>, since four tiles of
texture will be squeezed into the patch instead of the one.
</p><p>As with point dragging, you can hold down combinations of Shift
and Alt to drag the texture CP's or rows, columns or the whole
patch/quilt.
</p><p>Then on the Control Point RMB menu there's an item Texture
Coordinates; here you can enter them in numerically, with options
to extend the resulting change to the row, column or whole
patch/quilt.  This is functionally the same as dragging.
</p><p>Then finally, if a face is tagged, you can project the texture
of the patch from or to the tagged face.  This is a 'flat'
projection, so it won't look too good on seriously curved patches
(but would work fine for something like a buckled or warped
plate on a floor or wall).
