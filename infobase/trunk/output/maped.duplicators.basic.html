<p>The simplest duplicator for putting copies in a row
is the 'Basic Duplicator', the first item in the
New Polyhedrons|Duplicators &amp; Misc toolboxlist.
To see it at work, first create a new poly, then
make a group over it (by hitting the `new group'
panel button). Now, with either the group or the
cube selected, insert the Basic Duplicator.  What
you'll now see, in an XY view, is 5 blue outlines
of the original New Cube heading off at a 45 degree
angle.  These are the copies of the original brush.
</p><p>To control what's happening, push the tree-view
button in the browser panel select the newly inserted
Basic Duplicator, and look at its specifics.
There's 'classname', and 'copy outside', which should have
a check to its right, we'll look into those later.
The first one that interests us now is 'offset', which will
be the triple of numbers '32 32 0'.  This is the
amount, in the X, Y and Z dimensions, whereby each
copy is displaced from the previous one.  So we
can make the copies head out in the X direction,
spaced at a greater distance, by changing these
numbers to say '200 0 0'.
</p><p>The next number is 'count', which controls the
number of copies, so if you only want one, set it
to '1'.  Count is giving us the number of copies,
not including the original.
</p><p>Following that is 'angle'. This rotates each copy of the duplicated object by that amount in degrees from each copy's center, or origin, point. A positive number will rotate it counter clock wise and a negative number will rotate it clockwise. This creates a circular pattern of the duplicated object. They can then be made to create a stair step pattern by moving any of the solid blue handles up or down. The smaller the number used for 'angle' the bigger the circumference of the circular pattern becomes, because the rotation of each copy's center is less, and visa versa. This can also be done with the 'red ball' handle.
</p><p>The 'origin' specific, is where the duplicator is located and best controlled
by dragging it around, and 'macro', which you should leave alone until you're an expert.
</p><p>The point of duplicators is to have any changes you make
in the original show up automatically in the copies, so
you should now pull the faces of the cube around a bit,
to see the shapes of the copies change.  Also, if you drag
the cube with respect to the duplicator, the positions
of the copies will change.
</p><p>You also might have noticed that for each copy there is
a little blue square.  If you drag a square with the
mouse, you change the direction of the row and the spacing
of the copies along it.  Look at the 'offset' specific
while you're doing this, &amp; you'll see that what you're doing
is visually editing the offset.  So there's a quick way to get
things into the arrangement you want.
</p><p>So far we've only been making copies of single brushes.
But the Basic Duplicator (and many of the others)
makes copies of everything in the group that contains
it, including brushes, entities, and entities, except
duplicators themselves.  So if you put two different
brushes into the duplicator's group, you'll see them both
being copied.  This lets you make copies of structures as
complicated as you like.
</p><p>With a duplicator, you can edit the original, and see
the changes in all the copies, but you can't make
a change to some particular individual copy.  However
sometimes that is what you
want to do (perhaps to introduce some variations
into a bunch of things you've created).  You can
make the copies individually editable by RMB |
Dissociate Duplicator Images on the duplicator
(in the tree-view).  Now the duplicator is removed
from the map and replaced by the copies it has been
creating, as freestanding individual pieces of map
structure.  Of course when you do this, you lose the
advantage of having a duplicator.  With the undo facility,
you can get the duplicator back (until you close the
editing session), but then you'll also loose any individual
changes you've made.

<p>There are seven more Standard Duplicators beyond the Basic
Duplicator.  One of them, the Linear Duplicator, is
an enhanced version of the Basic Duplicator; we'll talk
about it last.  Then there is Copy One and 5 mirror
duplicators.
</p><p>Copy One makes a single copy, which you can put where you
want.  If you want to make a small number of copies, and
put them in assorted places (perhaps a few crates scattered
around in a room), you can put several Copy One duplicators
into the same group; each will make its own copies of the
things in the group, which you can locate with the blue
handles (notice however that if several duplicators are
located in the same group, they don't copy each other).
</p><p>Copy One is fine for making small numbers of copies, but for
larger numbers, the more complex Instance Duplicator would
be better.
</p><p>The mirror duplicators make copies located symmetrically
around an axis that passes through the duplicator
(equivalently, reflected in the plane perpendicular to
the axis).  There are Mirror X, Mirror Y and Mirror Z,
each making one copy, and Mirror XY, making three (so there
are either two or four shapes in all).  What if what you
want is say 4 structures in XZ, or 8 in all in XYZ?
There's a way to do that which we'll see in
<a href="maped.duplicators.basic.html#combinations">'Duplicator Combinations'</a>
below.
</p><p>The last of the standard duplicators is the Linear Duplicator,
whose special features are somewhat advanced, so we
talk about them in
<a href="maped.duplicators.basic.html#linear">'The Linear Duplicator'</a>
below.

<p>Various kinds of effects can be produced by using
more than one duplicator in a combination.
There are two kinds.
</p><p>First, more than one (standard) duplicator can be put into
the same group.  What will happen then is that each will
produce copies according to its own type and specifics.
So if you want for example to arrange the copies in
a cross shape, along the X and Y axes, you could use
four basic duplicators, with offsets '256 0 0', '-256 0 0',
'0 256 0' and '0 -256 0'.
</p><p>The second is more interesting.  A standard duplicator makes
copies of everything in the group that contains it.  What
if one of those things is itself a group with a duplicator?
It turns out that the pattern made by the lower duplicator gets
copied by the higher one, so that for example we can make not only
rows, but grids.  So for example to make a grid with 5 rows and
10 columns, you could use 2 Basic Duplicators, one with count
5, arranging things down the Y axis, and another with count 10,
arranging them down the X axis.
</p><p>We can use this technique to get the effects of some additional
Mirror-type duplicators.  For example if we wanted an XYZ mirroring,
we could use a Z Mirror and and XY Mirror.

<p>So finally we come to the Linear Duplicator.  This is
an enhanced version of the basic duplicator, with two
useful additional specifics:  scale and angles.  The values
of both are three numbers.
</p><p>Scale is numbers for multipling the size of the object in
the X, Y and Z dimensions.  Each object is multiplied in
size relative to the last, so you can get for example a
series of pillars of increasing height by setting scale
to something like '1 1 1.3' (no quotes in the actual value
entered in).  And the angles numbers specify rotation around
the Y, X and Z angles in succession (Pitch, Roll and Yaw).
So if you want each object to be spun 15 degrees around the
Z axis, but left the same on the others, '0 0 15' will do it.
</p><p>There are two more specifics, matrix and linear.  Neither
of these are likely to be useful to the average mapper, but
here's a quick explanation anyway.  Scaling and rotation are
particular kinds of 'linear transformatioms', which are
distortions of space (and or the objects in them) that can
be specified in terms of 9 numbers.  With the 'matrix' specific
you can enter the matrix of any linear transformation to
be applied to the object using its center as a 'fixed point',
while 'linear' does the same thing using the duplicator
location as the fixed point.
</p><p>Finally, for what it's worth, the 'angle' specific of the
Basic Duplicator specifies a rotation around the Z axis,
with the duplicator as fixed point.  Well so much for
that, now on to something a bit more useful.
</p><p>Which is suppose that you want to use scale, but you want
the copies to all be lined up the same on the bottom, but
each sticking up higher than the next?   First, the stuff to
be scaled in this way must be put in a group of its own,
then select the group in the tree-view, hit the Specifics tab,
and push the button captioned 'centering'.  A little light blue
handle should appear at the center of the group you have made.
This handle can then be dragged around, and will define the point
used as the center for linear operations on the group, including
the duplicator's scaling. So move the handle
down to the bottom of the brush, and if the scale
is 1 1 1.3, they will align on the bottom but get
successively taller.
</p><p>The 'User Center' of the group is also used as the center for rotations;
Note that if the linear duplicator's group contains two
brushes, each will rotate around its own center.  If we
want both brushes to rotate as one unit, we need to put them
under their own group, which can then have its own customizable
center.

<p>Suppose you want to make a row of lights, each with its own switch.  The triggers
will have 'target' specific, the targets a 'targetname' specific, but for the
thing to work, they will need to be different in each copy.  This can be acheived
by activating the incrementation facility for specifics.  The first step is to
check the duplicator's 'increment' specific.  Then choose as target and targetname
values something that ends in a digit, say 'light000'.  Now each copy will
have the final digit incremented by 1, so each trigger will activate its own
light.  This basic facility applies to 'target', 'targetname' and 'killtarget'
specifics, and uses 1 as the increment, but there are extensive facilities
for making things more flexible.
<ul>
<li>the 'incr. all target' checkbox specific will extend incrementation to
every specific that contains the string 'target' (e.g. 'closetarget')
<li>the 'incrementable' specific takes as its value a list of names of
additional specifics that are to be incremented (e.g. 'lip damage').
<li>'final_target' specifies a value that is to be used for target-value the last
copy, including None if the specific is to be omitted (for example there might
be a sequence of switches in which the last one activiated a door).  For any
specific name, we can add a final_<name> specific, e.g. 'final_killtarget'
which will work in the same way.
<li>'increment by' specifies the size of increment.  This can be used to produce
a grid of lights, each with its own switch; using say 10 as the increment for the
outer duplicator and 1 for the innder.
<li>'incre_lip' specifies a custom increment for the 'lip' specific; further
specifics of this kind beginning with 'incre_' can be added freely.
</ul>
</p><p>At time of writing, incrementation is implemented for the basic, linear, and
(new) copy-one duplicators.  More will probably be added in the future.
(Many of the ideas here, and some of the implementation, is due to subnoodle.)
