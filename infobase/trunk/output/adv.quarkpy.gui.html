<p>Since one reason for getting involved in QuArK development
is to learn something about GUI (Graphical User Interface)
programming, I thought I'd start at the beginning - if you want
to learn it, you probably don't know it already.  People with
GUI experience will want to skip this.
</p><p>One of the fundamental ideas of GUI programs is 'window'.
is a region (typically a rectangle) on the screen that is
looked after by some code. The job of this code is to;
</p><p><ol>
<li>draw the window's region, typically in different ways depending on what's going on at the time.
<li>respond to events that occur when the mouse cursor is in the window's region.
</ol>
</p><p>So a 'button' is a little window that draws a picture that
looks something like a button in an 'up position', but if
a mouse-button is pressed down while the mouse cursor is in
the window, the picture will change to that of a button
in a down position, and some additional code will get
executed that does whatever pressing the button is supposed
to accomplish.
</p><p>These windows are arranged in a vast familial hierarchy:
an 'application' (main program) has a main window which
has as 'child windows' all of the other windows that the
application throws up.  So for example when the application
is closed, a shut-down message is sent to its children,
and so on to their children, so if everything is correctly
coded, all the windows will vanish from the screen.
Likewise windows can 'delegate' tasks to their parents,
for example an 'edit window' in a dialog box can delegate
processing of an ESC or Enter keypress to its parent
dialog box, to close the dialog and throw away or record
the results of the dialog.
</p><p>Happily for the Python coder, Delphi code manages all of the
details of this, but it's probably good to have at least
this much of an idea of what's going on under the hood.

<p><u>Window Structure</u><br>
Dialog boxes are actually a special kind of 'floating window',
defined by the class quarkpy.qmacro.dialogbox.  Floating
windows are child windows of the application that float
around 'on top of' other windows, can be moved, and often
resized.  A floating window contains a further kind of
window, called a 'panel', whose purpose is to contain
and control the positioning of the windows that do the real
work, which are called '(screen) controls' (in jargon,
a QuArK panel is a sort of 'geometry manager').  Dialog
boxes put one screen control into their panel, an
extremely powerful creature called a 'dataform', which
makes automagical links between QObjects and areas of
the screen (Armin told me once that even he doesn't
remember everything about how they work).
</p><p>So the basic structure of a dialog box is:
</p><div class="doccode"><pre>
  Floating Window     -&gt;  Main Panel   -&gt;   DataForm
 (positions the whole   (positions the   (does the real
       thing)              conrols)          work)
</pre></div>

<p>(Main Panel because floating windows can have more than
once panel, as we will see eventually).  The qmacro.dialogbox
code sets all this up for you, but I think it's good to
know this much about it at the beginning.
</p><p><u>Defining a Dialog</u><br>
So down to the details.  We'll look at the MakeTexMultDlg
in plugins.maptagside, since it's very simple.  This
dialog asks for a number which the mapper is going to
use as a 'multiplier' to know how many times a texture
should be repeated when it's being wrapped along or around
a chain of faces.
</p><p>A dialog is defined as a class, descended from either
quarkpy.qmacro.dialogbox, or some class descended therefrom (see
quarkpy.qeditor and quarkpy.dlgclasses for some examples of the
latter technique).  MakeTexMultDlg is based directly on dialogbox,
so it starts out like this:
</p><div class="doccode"><pre>
class MakeTexMultDlg (quarkpy.qmacro .dialogbox):

    #
    # dialog layout
    #

    size = (265, 70)
    dfsep = 0.2        # separation at 20% between labels and edit boxes
    dlgflags = FWF_KEEPFOCUS
</pre></div>

<p>On the first line we see the standard Python syntax for
defining a class descended from another (the spacing before
the periods doesn't matter, some coders stick it in; others
leave it out); then after a comment comes an assortment of
attributes for the dialog. Size is obvious, 'dfsep' is a
dataform property.  Dataforms are organized in two columns,
labels on the left, and input controls on the right. The 'Txt'
attribute in a :form object says what to put in the label
column.  Dfsep gives the percentage of the total width of the
dataform that gets devoted to the label.  Then comes
'dlgflags', which are ultimately passed on to the floating
window, so they start with 'FWF_'.  For a list, see
quarkpy.qutils.py.  If you don't specify any dlgflags, the
dialogbox code gives you
</p><div class="doccode"><pre>
  FWF_KEEPFOCUS | FWF_POPUPCLOSE
</pre></div>

<p>by default.
</p><p>Next comes the 'dialog definition', dlgdef:
</p><div class="doccode"><pre>
    dlgdef = &quot;&quot;&quot;
        {
        Style = &quot;15&quot;
        Caption = &quot;Texture Wrapping Multiplier&quot;

        mult: =
        {
        Txt = &quot;Multiplier&quot;
        Typ = &quot;EF1&quot;
        Hint = &quot;Needn't be an integer; if it's 0, no multiplier is set&quot;
        }
        close:py = { }
    }
    &quot;&quot;&quot;
</pre></div>

<p>This is just a form, represented in .qrk format.  The value
to be assigned to dlgdef begins with triple double quotes,
and ends with them too, because it's a multi-line string.
Note that it can happily contain ordinary solo double quotes.
</p><p>It starts out with a style and a caption; the style is
a number obtained by adding these flags (from quarkpy.qutils):
</p><div class="doccode"><pre>
  # &quot;style&quot; of &quot;:form&quot; objects (convert the numeric value into a string to assign to &quot;style&quot;)
  GF_GRAY       = 1
  GF_EXTRASPACE = 2
  GF_NOICONS    = 4
  GF_NOBORDER   = 8
</pre></div>

<p>Then comes one field, a single floating point value called
mult:, and finally a button, of which more shortly.
</p><p>There are a number of gotchas for forms:
</p><p><ol><li>
     The syntax is full of easy-to-screw up punctuation,
     and the error-messages tell you what line in the quoted
     string is wrong, rather than in the file, so you
     have to do some arithmetic to use the info (so I
     always start by dlgdefs by taking some other one that's
     already done as a basis, and modifying it).
<li>
     Buttons in forms are a horrible mess.  I don't have
     a deep enough understanding to know why Armin couldn't
     find one good implementation, but actually there are
     three crappy ones (2 by him, 1 by me), that work in
     different contexts.  This dialog box uses 'PyButtons',
     which are but into forms by lines like this:
<span class="doccode">
     close:py = { }
</span>
     (the content of the button is specified later)
<li>
      You can't put comments into these triple quote-defined
      forms, the function that reads them can't strip them
      out.
</ol>
</p><p>Other than buttons, almost everything that works in an
entity form will work in a dialog box form, and vice versa,
I think (it would take a long time to test them all!!).
One other exceptions is checkboxes:  in entity forms,
you can have Typ = &quot;X4&quot;, say to control the third bit
position, but in dialog boxes only Typ = &quot;X&quot; works,
this gives you an variable that's nonzero iff the
box is checked, zero otherwise.
</p><p>So you can use most of the Typ types that you understand
to build dialog box forms, one that's rather useful for
making a bit of extra horizontal space is a separator like
this:
</p><div class="doccode"><pre>
      sep: = {Typ=&quot;S&quot; Txt=&quot; &quot;}
</pre></div>

<p>The Txt part has three formats you can use:
1) Txt=&quot;&quot; gives a horizontal line separator
2) Txt=&quot; &quot; just separates with a blank area (note the space)
3) Txt=&quot;Your Label&quot; will print the text in bold lettering
</p><p>So next comes initialization of the dialog box object:
</p><div class="doccode"><pre>
    #
    # __init__ initialize the object
    #

    def __init__(self, form, editor):

    #
    # General initialization of some local values
    #

        self.editor = editor
        self.sellist = self .editor .visualselection ()
</pre></div>

<p>This is the beginning of a Python 'constructor' a function
that makes an instance of a class (think of a class as a
template or factory for making objects; you call the
constructor as a function to make an instance of the object).
</p><p>In Python, functions that get special treatment tend to start
and end with double underscores, as here with __init__.
To make this dialog box, you write:
</p><div class="doccode"><pre>
   MakeTexMultDlg(quarkx.clickform, editor)
</pre></div>

<p>Python then calls the ReplaceTextureDlg class's
__init__ function to set up the dialog object.  The first
is by convention 'self', referring to the object (the rule
is that the first argument is the object; the convention
is to call it 'self').
</p><p>The second argument 'form' is meant to be the parent window
of the dialog, quarkx.clickform sets it to be the last
window that got clicked in (e.g. the one you clicked in
to bring up the dialog).  The remaining arguments depend
solely on what we want the dialog to do, here we're
just passing 'editor'.
</p><p>Next comes some real setup code:  we attach the editor and
its current visualselection() (the stuff that's in funny
colors due to being selected, not selected faces in a
selected poly) to the dialog as data members (this allows
other methods of the dialog class to act on them as desired).
</p><p>Now comes the crucial step of 'creating the data source':
</p><div class="doccode"><pre>
        #
        # Create and fill the data source
        #

        src = quarkx.newobj(&quot;:&quot;)   # make it
        src[&quot;mult&quot;] = 0,           # fill it
        editor.texmult = self      # attach dialog to editor
        self.src = src             # attach src to dialog
</pre></div>

<p>The heart of a dialog box is its DataForm, which connects
stuff on the screen to a QObject.  src is the QObject
that the dialogbox will do this for.  So first we make it,
and then we fill it.
</p><p>The comma after the 0 is not typo, but a gotcha: EFn Typ's
expect a Python tuple as their filler, and the comma
here is how you make a singleton tuple (I had a *lot* of
trouble before getting straight on that one!).  Finally
we want the editor to have some way of knowing what
multiplier we set; this is acheived in this case by
attaching the dialog to the editor, and then the source
to the dialog, so that multiplier can be gotten by
this line elsewhere in maptagside:
</p><div class="doccode"><pre>
    multiplier, = editor.texmult.src[&quot;mult&quot;]
</pre></div>

<p>Note the comma again, for pulling the solo value out of a
singleton tuple (actually if you're looking at maptagside from
QuArK511 or earlier, there's something a bit different done, since
this was my first dialog box and I knew less about what I was
doing).  editor.texmult.src[&quot;mult&quot;] returns the value of the
specific &quot;mult&quot; for the src QObject of the editor, and by the
automagical powers of the dialogbox's dataform, this will be
whatever you currently have typed in there.
</p><p>The next step is to call the code from
quarkpy.qmacro.dialogbox that actually puts all this together
and makes the stuff:
</p><div class="doccode"><pre>
    #
    # Create the dialog form and the buttons
    #

        quarkpy.qmacro.dialogbox.__init__(self, form, src,
        close = quarkpy.qtoolbar.button(
            self.close,         # method called on push
            &quot;close this box&quot;,   # hint
            ico_editor, 0,      # icon source, icon #
            &quot;Close&quot;))           # caption
</pre></div>

<p>We're here calling quarkpy.qmacro.dialogbox's own __init__
function, as an ordinary function, so we pass it's first
argument as 'self'. So it will set up the dataform, etc,
attaching more stuff to our dialog box instance.  We also
pass through the form argument, as well as the src we've
created.  And finally a list of buttons (here just one).
The field are explained; for each 'buttonname:py' in the
Dlgdef, we have to have buttonname = ... passed to the
initialization.  These equalities here are an aspect of
Python's very flexible parameter-passing mechanism, which
I won't explain here.
</p><p>And finally, we have to define any methods used by the
dialog; here there's only one, onclose(), which the
quarkpy.dialogbox code causes to be executed when the
dialog closes for the purpose of cleaning things up.
</p><div class="doccode"><pre>
    def onclose(self, dlg):
      requestmultiplier.state=qmenu.normal
      self.editor.texmult = None
      quarkpy.qmacro.dialogbox(self, close)
</pre></div>

<p>The onclose() method requires two arguments, the dialog 'self',
and its floating window 'dlg', and should also call the
qmacro.dialogbox.onclose method, so that the cleanup organized by
that occurs.  Here the additional work is done of restoring the
menu item  to normal, and detaching the dialog from the editor.
It's a simple example of a 'callback' function; as we'll see,
the dialog initialization code passes it to the floating window,
and then when the floating window shuts down, it runs this
function, 'calling back' into the module that provided it.
</p><p>But we don't have to define a close() method, since that's
already taken care of in the qmacro.dialogbox code.
</p><p>So finally, how do we make this dialog box?  That's done
by this little code:
</p><div class="doccode"><pre>
def WrapMultClick(m):
  editor = mapeditor()
  if editor is None: return
  if requestmultiplier.state==qmenu.checked:
#    requestmultiplier.state=qmenu.normal
    editor.texmult.close(None)
  else:
    requestmultiplier.state=qmenu.checked
    MakeTexMultDlg(quarkx.clickform,editor)
</pre></div>

<p>This is a toggle; requestmultiplier is a menu item, if its
state is checked, the dialog's close function is called, which
unchecks the menu item (the earlier version just unchecked the
menu item but left the dialog floating; if you prefer that
behavior, move the comment #). But if it's normal (unchecked),
then it gets checked *and* the dialog is called up.  The menu
item can be defined after the function that refers to it
because the function gets called later (when a menu item is
clicked).
</p><p>So there's a walk thru a small but complete box (tho a bit
unusual in its mode of operation).
</p><p>A few more general points on the dialogs.  First, the dialogbox
definition sets up two callbacks, whereby things can be made
to happen when something is done to the window, plus the
close method:
</p><div class="doccode"><pre>
    def datachange(self, df):
       # called when the data is changed

    def onclose(self, dlg):
       # called on closing

    def close(self)
       # effects closing
</pre></div>

<p>Datachange() doesn't do anything in qmacro.dialogbox, so
the original doesn't need to be called if you override it,
but close() and onclose() do do things, so should have their
originals called.
</p><p>Second, the dialog boxes are inherently 'modeless'.  That
means that when you call one, the program doesn't wait for
you to enter a value before proceeding.  If you want to
fake modal behavior, by having something happen after you've
provided some values and closed the box, you have to pass
the action you want performed as a parameter to the dialog
box.  The texture positioning dialog in maptexpos.py
illustrates this and various other advanced techniques.

<p>A QuArK dialog box is just a restricted kind of floating
window; so now it's time to look into the code that
defines them and see how floating windows work in general.
</p><p>dialog boxes are defined as a class in quarkpy.qmacro;
the definition starts out like this:
</p><div class="doccode"><pre>
class dialogbox:

    dlgdef = &quot;&quot;
    size = (300,170)
    begincolor = None
    endcolor = None
    name = None
    dfsep = 0.6
    dlgflags = qutils.FWF_KEEPFOCUS | qutils.FWF_POPUPCLOSE
</pre></div>

<p>Here we're just providing default values for the various
things that can be defined when a more specific type of
dialog is created as a subclass.
</p><p>Now comes the most important method of this class, its
constructor (which we have already invoked as part of the
constructor of the texture multiplier dialag):
</p><div class="doccode"><pre>
    def __init__(self, form, src, **buttons):
        name = self.name or self.__class__.__name__
        closedialogbox(name)
        f = quarkx.newobj(&quot;Dlg:form&quot;)
        f.loadtext(self.dlgdef)
</pre></div>

<p>The first three parameters are self-explanatory (if you've
read through dialogs.txt), the last is the magic for dealing
with the buttons, don't worry about it now.  Next we derive
a name for the box, and close any already opened one with the
same name (closedialogbox() is defined elsewhere in
quarkpy.qmacro).  And now something interesting happens;
we create an actual form object, and then load in whatever
text has wound up assigned to dlgdef.  loadtext is actually
one of the methods of QObjects (QuArK internal objects);
it would not be amiss to look it up in Quarkx.rtf.
</p><p>And so here's our next chunk of code:
</p><div class="doccode"><pre>
        self.f = f
        for pybtn in f.findallsubitems(&quot;&quot;, ':py'):
            pybtn[&quot;sendto&quot;] = name
        self.buttons = buttons
        dlg = form.newfloating(self.dlgflags, f[&quot;Caption&quot;])
</pre></div>

<p>The first line simply stores the form we've made as a data
member of the dialog, the next three are button-processing
magic, and finally we create our new floating window.
If you look up newfloating() in quarkx.rtf, you'll see that
it's a method of window objects (the one that was passed
as the form argument), which takes as first argument
a bunch of flags, and second a string to use as a caption.
f[&quot;Caption&quot;] is just an instance of the syntax whereby
the value of a specific (&quot;Caption&quot;) of a QObject (f), is
fetched, so the net result is that whatever we put
in as value of the Caption specific of the dlgdef gets
passed to the new floating window as its caption.
</p><p>Next comes assorted housekeeping.
</p><div class="doccode"><pre>
        dialogboxes[name] = dlg
        dlg.windowrect = self.windowrect()
        if self.begincolor is not None: dlg.begincolor = self.begincolor
        if self.endcolor is not None: dlg.endcolor = self.endcolor
        dlg.onclose = self.onclose
        dlg.info = self
        self.dlg = dlg
        self.src = src
</pre></div>

<p>dialogboxes is a global variable of quarkpy.qmacros, so this
registers our current dialog box as one that is open.
Next we set the dimensions of  the new floating window
(check the qmacro code for how windowrect() works), and attach
various further data members to the floating window and the
dialog box object.  It would be good to look up the things
attributed to dlg (the floating window) in Quarkx.rtf.
</p><p>But a warning about some terminological confustion:  windows
sometimes get called `forms' and are thereby subject to betting
confuse with :form objects, but these are inherently
different!
</p><p>And now some more interesting stuff:
</p><div class="doccode"><pre>
        df = dlg.mainpanel.newdataform()
        self.df = df
        df.header = 0
        df.sep = self.dfsep
</pre></div>

<p> When floating windows are created, they automatically
 get a panel, which is accessed as `mainpanel'.  And
 then a panel's newdataform() method will create a new
 dataform in the panel, the first line gives us the dataform
 df, a child of the window dlg's main panel.  So we've
 now built the three-level structure mentioned at the
 beginning of the dialogs tutorial.  Now we set some
 dataform attributes; setting the header to 0 supresses
 the `specific' and `arg' headers that you see at the top
 of the columns when entity specifics are displayed in
 the multi-page panel, then the dfsep attribute of the
 dialog object is applied to the dataform, where it does
 its real work.
</p><p> And finally comes the essential setdata method:
</p><div class="doccode"><pre>
        df.setdata(src, f)
</pre></div>

<p>This establishes the connection between the screen and the
src object we created earlier.  The contents of src are
displayed in the dataform df, in accordance with the layout
specified in the form f.  And we conclude with a few more
details:
</p><div class="doccode"><pre>
        df.onchange = self.datachange
        df.flags = 8   # DF_AUTOFOCUS
        dlg.show()
</pre></div>

<p>The onchange method of a dataform is a method that gets
executed when the data is changed.  So if you want something
to happen whenever the data is changed, as in the texture
positioning dialog or the `slider' dialog (mapslide), you
organize this, for a dialog box, by providing a datachange
method.  The flags determine aspects of the presentation
of the dataform, the available ones are:
</p><div class="doccode"><pre>
# dataform flags
DF_LOCAL        = 1    # prevents screen flashes if changes in this box don't affect anything else
DF_AUTOFOCUS    = 8    # gets focus when mouse cursor enters
</pre></div>

<p>And finally, the last line makes it show up on the screen;
in GUI programming, things are normally kept hidden until
their finished being built, to make things look polished.
</p><p>So here are the remaining methods:
</p><div class="doccode"><pre>
    def datachange(self, df):
        pass   # abstract

    def onclose(self, dlg):
        dlg.info = None
        dlg.onclose = None   # clear refs
        if self.df is not None:
            self.df.onchange = None
            self.df = None
        self.dlg = None
        del self.buttons

    def close(self, reserved=None):
        self.dlg.close()
</pre></div>

<p>datachange is defined here in a content-free manner so that
there's something to be assigned as the df's onchange method,
regardless of whether it's really needed or not.  The
onclose method sets lots of things to None, in order to
prevent circular references from causing memory leaks (see
the discussion in Quarkx.rtf).  You should have noticed
the lines whereby these are passed as callbacks to the
floating window and the dataform.  close() on the other
hand, is not a callback, but calls the floating window's
own close() method.
</p><p>Once you understand how dialog boxes are built, you can
meddle with them in various ways; so in quarkpy.dlgclasses.py
there is defined placepersistent_dialogbox, which remembers
where it was last opened (basically by fiddling with
windowrect()).  And from that is defined LiveEditDlg,
which is specialized for controlling things that move in
the views as you change the data.
</p><p>And dialog boxes are far from being the only kind of
floating window, the face flags window that is obtained
for Q2 engine games by RMB|Texture Flags|Flags ...
is a substantially different one.  Its code is produced
by the MapLayout.flagsclick method in quarkpy.mapgr.
</p><p>I won't go over it in detail but just mention a few things.
This window doesn't just appear for a while and vanish
when you change the selection, but persists, and fills
up with appropriate face flag data whenever you select
something that has faces.
</p><p>The setup code is bracketted by some bookkeeping that
makes sure that there's only one face flags window
open at any one time, and then it gets its form from
the .qrk files, by code which has the effect that
the last .qrk to load that defines a TextureFlag form
is the one whose TextureFlag form gets used (so an
addon for a game would overrule the basic data for the
game).  Note that `flist[-1]' designates the last element
of flist (think of flist as a circular list, first element
being 0).
</p><p>Things should look routine until:
</p><div class="doccode"><pre>
            df.actionchanging = 596
</pre></div>

<p>Part of the df magic is that if a dataform changes
any QObject that comes from a file, this change is
registered in the undo mechanism, and the actionchanging
number is the index of the undo string, defined in
quarkpy.qdictionnary.
</p><p>So things burble along thru:
</p><div class="doccode"><pre>
        self.loadfaceflags(form)
        ff.show()
</pre></div>

<p>ff.show()?  Well remember that ff is a floating window, not
a dialog object, and windows are shown.  ff probably for
`floating form', because of the window/form terminology
confusion mentioned earlier.
</p><p>And we should be able to guess that loadfaceflags is the
function that's going to load the face data into ff's
dataform, under the control of the TextureFlags form.
And if you look at its definition, it's clear that it does
this, except there's a bit of a surprise at the end:
</p><div class="doccode"><pre>
        df.setdata(self.loadtfflist(), form)
</pre></div>

<p>When you look at loadtfflist(), you find a rather
complicated function!  Which, in brief, is doing this:
The faces in the current selection are gathered into a list.
Then the names of the textures in the list are made to be
keys for a dictionary, whose values are the textures,
and each member of the face list flist is replaced by
a pair with the original member first and its texture
second.  And that's what's returned to be the first argument
of setdata.
</p><p>Which is thereby revealed to be even more subtle than
suggested so far: it can operate on many objects at once,
and display in the form default information provided from
a default object rather than the thing being edited itself.
</p><p>Here's what it says in <a href="src.quarkx.html">'QuarkX'</a>:
</p><div class="doccode"><pre>
setdata(objs) setdata(objs, formobj):
</pre></div>
<ul>
<li>Select the object(s) whose Specifics/Args are to be
  displayed in the data form. objs can be either a single
  &quot;&nbsp;objspec&nbsp;&quot; or a list of &quot;&nbsp;objspecs&nbsp;&quot;. An &quot;&nbsp;objspec&nbsp;&quot; i
  either a single object or a tuple of two objects : the
  actual object and another one with default values.
  If a Specific is not found in the object, the data
  form displays the one from its default value. The
  optional argument formobj gives a :form Internal object
  to use.
</ul>

<p>So for example for a face, if the face doesn't have
some property but the face's texture specifies a default
for that property, the default will be shown in the window.
And, automagically, if you edit the specific, the change
will be registered undoably in all of the (non-default)
objects that have been presented to setdata.  Whew.
</p><p>So, finally, how does the form load with data for a new
face when the selection changes?  Via this method
of MapLayout:
</p><div class="doccode"><pre>
    def selchange(self):
        if self.faceflags is not None:
            self.loadfaceflags()
        self.mpp.resetpage()
</pre></div>

<p>To finish off, a bit more about panels.  Panels can contain
more than one control, by being divided into sections.
To see how it's done, study panels in Quarkx.rtf, and
look at plugins/map3viewslayout.py, which is quite well
commented.  The basic idea is to divide panels into sectons
with statements like:
</p><div class="doccode"><pre>
        self.mainpanel.sections = ((), (0.4,))
</pre></div>

<p>Which says one column, two rows with the top taking up
40% of the space, and:
</p><div class="doccode"><pre>
        self.ViewXY = self.mainpanel.newmapview()
        self.ViewXY.section = (0,1)
</pre></div>

<p>Which creates a map view (another kind of control) in the
main panel, and then puts it in the first column (there's
only one) of the lower row.  Then the code goes on to put
a panel in the upper row, and put two more map views into
that.
