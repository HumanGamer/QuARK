To make an arch, first click on the cube icon in the user
panel, or use whatever technique you normally use to make
a more or less cubical brush.  Then, in a side-on map-view,
select the brush and <span class="act">'RMB -&gt; Curves -&gt; Arch'</span>.
</p><p>An arch-shape will appear inside the brush, and if the brush
isn't selected, it will be invisible. If you open up a 3d view and
look around, you'll see that there are patches with textures
on the front and back, and inside curve.
</p><p><img border=1 align=right src="maped.builders.archcap.archtv.png">
What's happened is that the original brush has been put
inside a duplicator, which makes it invisible unless selected.
You can see this by looking at the tree view, as illustrated:
</p><p>The duplicator then controls the production of the actual
patches comprising the arch, by means that we will shortly
start manipulating.
</p><p>Of course, due to the one-sided visibility of patches, the
arch isn't a very satisfactory piece of archicture until we
put it into a suitable architectural environment.
But first, a bit more about the arch itself.  You might think
that once made, it's made, and what you see is all you get,
but not at all.  First, click on the arch until its `guide brush'
(the one inside its duplicator) is selected.
</p><p>We can now drag this brush around, and the arch will move, and
we can reproportion the arch by dragging the individual faces.
Since these are ordinary faces, which provide data to the duplicator
code the makes the arch patches, we can do all the ordinary face
stuff to them, such as tag/glue.
</p><p><table border=0 cellpadding=0>
<tr><td valign=top>
</p><p>So the next step is to make a wall with a hole in it,
using whatever your favorite technique for doing this is (if you
want to live dangerously, you can subtract with the arch brush
before or after turning the original brush
into an arch).
</p><p>Now move the arch's `guide brush' into the hole,
and line everything up so that the sides and the top are flush
with the sides of the hole, and the bottom is where you want it.
In a 3d view, things should look as more or less as
shown:
</p><p></td><td valign=top>

</td></tr>
<tr><td valign=top>
</p><p>Now, when we select the duplicator itself (which can be done without
opening the tree view by selecting the brush and
<span class="act">'RMB -&gt; Navigate Tree -&gt; Arch -&gt; Select'</span>), we'll see something like this:
</p><p>When the duplicator is selected, the tracery of bezier
mesh lines becomes visible.  Also, in an OGL view, the brush itself
takes on a reddish color (this doesn't happen in the other
views).  It is also possible that the textures might be misaligned,
so controlling that is our next topic.
</p><p></td><td valign=top>
<img  src="maped.builders.archcap.arch3.png">
</td></tr>
<tr><td valign=top>
</p><p>Arches get the textures of their front and back faces
off the front and back faces of their guide brush.  So all
we have to is to tag some face of the wall (assuming the other
wall bits are properly aligned), then select the front face
of the arch's guide brush, and then <span class="act">'RMB -&gt; Project Texture from Tagged'</span>,
and ditto for the back wall.  The results should look more or
less as to the right (the red line is the part of the outline
of the wall-face that the texture was projected from).
</p><p>If your arch's front or back
textures are misaligned, you should fix them now; if they're not,
mess them up and then fix them.
</p><p></td><td valign=top>
<img  src="maped.builders.archcap.arch4.png">
</td></tr>
</table>
</p><p>The inside of the arch is unfortunately not so straightforward.  It
would be nice if there was some way to wrap the texture on the front
or back onto the inside curve, but there isn't, at least without using
specially pre-prepared and proportioned textures.  So we basically
are stuck with a misalignment here, which can be ameliorated
by using some fairly bland, unpatterned texture on the inside
face (there's a further amelioration we'll get to later, after
dealing with the arch/cap duplicator specifics).
</p><p><table border=0 cellspacing=0>
<tr><td valign=top>
</p><p>But what we can do is get the textures aligned around the inside
of the archway.  The inside curve gets
its texture off the top face of the guide-brush.  So basically
what we want to do is wrap that texture onto the two walls.
However for geometrical reasons we don't want to quite do that.
To set the scene, raise the bottom of the guide-brush to explose
some bare wall-side, then select the top face of the guide-brush
and put a suitable ceiling-texture on it.  The results might look
like this as to the right.
</p><p></td><td valign=top>
<img  src="maped.builders.archcap.arch5.png">
</td></tr>
<tr><td valign=top>
</p><p>Next, tag the top face of  guide brush, then select a wall, as
indicated to the right:
</p><p>Finally, on the selected face, do <span class="act">'RMB -&gt; Texture -&gt; Wrapping -&gt; From tagged mirror'</span>.
The texture on the curve ought to now extend
down the wall, smoothly aligned.  Repeat on the other side, and
it's done.
</p><p></td><td valign=top>
<img  src="maped.builders.archcap.arch6.png">
</td></tr>
</table>
</p><p>But if you look closely with an patterned texture, you'll see
that the texture scale is compressed somewhat on the curved portion;
that's because its being positioned and scaled on the curve so
that it will join up smoothly with what's on the walls, but
the distance around the flat wall face is longer than on the
smooth curve-face.  This is because of a bit of tricky coding
in the duplicator, whereby the texture scale is compressed
just enough so that the distance in texture-space around
the curve equals the distance, w.r.t the top-face scale, around
the three faces defining the arch.
</p><p>A final point: for some textures, especially small and/or
non-square ones, this positioning trick doesn't work and the
textures come out strangely warped.  This is a bug I haven't
tracked down yet; to use these texture on inside arches, you
have to check the `stretchtex' box, &amp; you'll have to manage
alignments manually.

<p>The arch now looks OK, but we've left out an important step,
caulking.  The problem with it now is that the engine will
actually draw the brush-faces that are concealed by the curves,
which is a waste, because they can't be seen.  The solution
is to attach a the 'special/caulk' shader to the hidden faces.
For the top slab that sits over the arch, we can easily just
do this, but for the sides it's a bit more of a chore, because
part of the inside faces of the walls are exposed, and others
aren't (this is also a 't-junct', which is Evil.<BR><BR>
</p><p>So there's a little trick to speed up caulking.  Tag say the
left face of the guide-brush of the arch, then select the
right-face of the left wall-block.  Now RMB|More Tagging|Caulk
from tagged.  The wall will be split into two, and the caulk
pasted onto the part of the wall that's hidden.<BR><BR>
</p><p>In QuArK, you can see a bit of the caulk-texture where the curve
and the wall join, but in Quake3a you can't (I'm not sure if
QuArK's behavior is a bug or a feature).  Of course, if you
reproportion the arch, you'll need to adjust the walls as well;
a good application for Tag Face/Glue to Tagged.<BR><BR>

The RMB menu currently offers three basic
shapes (arch/cap, bevel, column) in two orientations each, but
the 'duplicators' that implement these shapes have a
considerable number of specifics that implement variations.
You can see what these specifics do by making an arch and
experimenting.   If you uncheck the 'inverse' specific for
example, the arch will turn into a 'cap'.  In general, inverse
shapes have their textures on a concave curve-side, non-inverse
on a convex one.
</p><p>Another useful one is 'lower'.  This flips the arch upside-down,
so that the curved surface is a U that you can walk over.
Lower arches take their texture from their bottom ('down')
rather than their top ('up') faces.  Then there's 'onside',
which lays the arch down its side, to make a curved wall.
</p><p>Another is 'stretchtex'.  If this is checked, then whatever
texture on the back face will be stretched to cover the
curve, without any of the alignment manipulations.  This
is useful if you have a specially prepared texture that
you specifically want to put on a curve, but not elsewhere.

<p>The arch/cap duplicator code is fairly complicated, and
various things can go wrong.  The typical symptom is
that the arch disappears, because something goes wrong with the
code that generates its `images'; (the patches that it's
supposed to produce, in this case).<BR><BR>
</p><p>When this happens, inspect the duplicator
in the tree view and check that the following
things are true:
<UL>
<LI>There is exactly one brush under it (other stuff
can easily find its way in, everything but the first
brush will be ignored and effectively disappeared from
the map).
<LI>That brush has six faces labelled front, back, up, down
left, right.
<LI>These faces are in the expected relationship to each
other (if you're staring at front, `right' is to the right,
etc.).
</UL>
This is all important because the face-names are used
by the code that generates the brushes.<BR><BR>
</p><p>If all this seems OK and it still doesn't work, something
deeper is wrong, post on the quark or quark-python forum.
<BR><BR>
</p><p>Two other things that might go wrong are:
<UL>
<LI> texture distortion on the curve, for some (small,
non-rectangular) textures.
<LI> `cracks&amp;180; between the seams of complex architecture, when
Q3A is run with hi r_subdivisions values.
</UL>
The first is a bug with no real cure, the remedies are to either
use another corner, or check `stretchtex'; and do texture alignments
by hand.<BR><BR>
</p><p>For the second, the problem is that Q3A is tesselating the two
patches to different extends.  Currently, the fix is to dissociate
the images of the duplicators, then use the mesh|double rows/column
RMB commands to increase the number of control points along the
edge, and also Tag Point|Knit edge to tagged to check that
everything is lined up right.  I soon hope to add some more
specifics to the duplicators that will have them generate thicker
meshes, so that dissociation won't be necessary.  Also more options,
so that invisible patches can be excluded from complex
architecture without dissociation.<BR><BR>
</p><p>At present, finding a bad arch could be difficult; there
should eventually be diagnostic functions for these duplicators
and some sort of map-check for them to pick up the bad ones.

<TR><TD COLSPAN=2>I'll discuss two techniques here,
the use of a 'thick'; arch to avoid texture
misalignments between the front face and the inside edges,
and how to do a round porthole with no texture seam
around the curved opening.
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>
Start with something like the uninspiring archway to the
right.  Basically what we're going to do is create
a whole nother arch inside it, with the same dimensions,
but with a 'thickness'; projecting inward, with a different
texture and a curved 'seam' on the front and back.  Note that
the bottom of the arch has been pulled off the floor.
</TD><TD>
<img  src="maped.builders.archcap.arch7.jpg">
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>
A way to do this is as follows.  First select the arch's
guide-brush, and then Edit | Duplicate from the top menu.
If you look inside the arch duplicator you'll see that there
are two brushes.  Drag one of them out out from inside the duplicator
so that it is sister the duplicator rather than inside it,
select it, and finally
RMB | Curves | Arch in a map view, looking at it from
the front.  You'll now have two identical arches occupying
the same space.
Now select one of the arches and look at its specifics,
and input a value such as say 8 into its 'thick' specific.
</p><p>You should now see an extra thickness protruding
inward around the curved surface, onto which you can put
some different texture.  Next you'll want to make two side
brushes to put under the overhang, before
doing the textures.  To the right is a wirefrom view of
what things might look like now.
</td><td>
<img  src="maped.builders.archcap.arch8.png">
</td></tr>
<table>
<tr><td>
Now the idea is to put onto the front faces of the arch and the
side-blocks the same texture as will go on the inside surface, so
that there won't be a sharp texture-discrepancy around the edge
of the opening.  Also, the fronts of the side-brushes and the arch
can be pulled out a bit to make a protruding `lip'.  As a final
elabortion, you should push the `details' button on entity specifics
page, and suppress the creation of faces that can't be seen.
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
There is also the problem of getting the textures aligned around
the inside of the opening.  This is a bit tricky, but here's
a procedure.  Put the texture you want on to top face of the
thick arch's guide brush, tag that face, and then wrap it
down onto the hidden (facing the wall) faces of the two
side brushes.  Then tag this hidden face of one brush, and
project the texture onto its opposite exposed 
face (facing into the archway),
and repeat for the second brush.
</TD>
<TD><!--<img src=images/curves/shapes/tech3.jpg WIDTH=213 HEIGHT=203
  alt="arch shape">-->
</TD></TR>
<tr><td>
This can be tricky and confusing because of all the mirror-image
type reversals from wrapping and projecting textures onto
faces pointing in opposite directions, but it can be made
to work out.  One point to keep in mind is that the texture
you put on the top face of the arch's guide brush is
reflected (mirror-imaged once) when you see it on the
inside surface of the arch; when you wrap it onto the hidden
faces of the side-brushes it doesn't get reflected, only
rotated, but finally gets reflected when you project it from
the hidden face to the exposed one.
(So it's confusing; figuring it out was worse).
</td></tr>
<tr><td>And finally, Alex Haarer's archlib plugins provides an
assortment of complex prefab arch structures.
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
Another technique I'll describe verbally without pikkies is
a round porthole.  First make a square opening, fit a
brush into it exactly, wrap a texture seamlessly around
the brush (the faces that contact the opening), and project
the top and bottom textures of the brush onto the
top and bottom faces of the opening.  Then cut the brush in
half so that you have two brushes, one on top of the other,
exactly touching, filling the bottom and top half of the
opening.
Now make each brush into an arch, set the lower one to
lower, and project the top and bottom textures of the
opening to the top and bottom faces of the corresponding
brush.  That should do it.
