<p>There's a bit of a problem with this, because tagging.py is already
drawing the tagged sides, tho a bit late; to see the effects
of what we do we need to go into `plugins\tagging', and comment
out the line that says:
<div class="doccode"><pre>
#quarkpy.qbaseeditor.BaseEditor.finishdrawing = tagfinishdrawing
</pre></div>
or else
<div class="doccode"><pre>
#quarkpy.mapeditor.MapEditor.finishdrawing = tagfinishdrawing
</pre></div>
(At time of writing, the former line is occurring; it might get
revised to the latter).  To ham up the difference between the
standard one and the one we're building, we'll also have the
new one draw the tagged face in blue.
</p><p>The technique is again to redefine something, this time a method
of a class, `finishdrawing', of `mapeditor', in quarkpy.mapeditor.
Finishdrawing operates late in the map-drawing procedure and adds
various finishing touches.
</p><p>While writing the tutorial, I noticed that tagging.py was actually
redefining fininishdrawing of BaseEditor in quarkpy.qbaseeditor;
this is actually not fully correct (tho it's been working fine in
QuArK for a long time), since qbaseeditor is supposed to be the
base class for both map and model editors, and face-tagging is clearly
relevant only to the former.
</p><p>Anyway here's the code for the new procedure:
<div class="doccode"><pre>
def tagfinishdrawing(editor, view, oldfinish=quarkpy.mapeditor.MapEditor.finishdrawing):
    &quot;the new finishdrawing routine&quot;

    oldfinish(editor, view)
    tagged = gettagged(editor)
    if tagged is None: return
    #
    # OK, so there is something tagged, so lets draw it.  A `view' is one
    #  of the map-displays on the screen, such as the top-down or side on
    #  one in the classic layout.
    #
    cv = view.canvas()
    #
    # We'll color them like Duplicators so we can see an effect
    #
    cv.pencolor = MapColor(&quot;Duplicator&quot;)
    #
    #  A face has a list of lists of vertexes.  A list of lists because
    #   each face might be used in several polyhedrons, in each polyhedron
    #   the vertexes are listed in a clockwise order as you move around
    #   the edge of the face's manifestation in the polyhedron.
    #
    for vtx in editor.tagging.tagged.vertices: # for a face-manifestation
        #
        # proj turns a 3D point in the map into a point in the display,
        # as determined by the properties of the view  (it's got three
        # coordinates but the functions of z vary).  We start with the
        # last vertex (index pozzie -1 in Python), and cycle through,
        # connecting the last to the first, and so on
        #
        p2 = view.proj(vtx[-1])
        for v in vtx:
            p1 = p2
            p2 = view.proj(v)
            cv.line(p1,p2)  # draw the line
</pre></div>
<div class="doccode"><pre>
quarkpy.mapeditor.MapEditor.finishdrawing = tagfinishdrawing
</pre></div>
Now when we tag a side, at first nothing happens, but then if
we click in the map area, it gets drawn in blue, so at we
can see that our new finishdrawing is doing something.
</p><p>What we want is to get the map redrawn right after we have tagged
the face, and the way to do it is to add:
<div class="doccode"><pre>
        editor.invalidateviews()
</pre></div>
at the very end of the tagSideClick function, right after the tagging
info is added to the editor.  `invalidateviews' will cause the
map views to be redrawn on the basis of the new info, and the blue
will show up immediately.

<p>But there is still a problem.  Tag a face, and then move it.  The blue
line will probably stay behind in its original position.  And if you
use the Glue to Tagged command, you'll see the glued side snapping
to the original position of the the moved face, not the present
position.  These aren't really show-stopping bugs, but it's still
goofy behavior.    What's going on is that
the editor's tagging.tagged attribute is storing the old face, while
the effect of the movement was to subsitute a new one; QuArK doesn't
do a very good job of keeping track of identity of map objects as we
tend to construe it.
</p><p>What we want to do is check that the tagged object is still in
the map, before doing things that depend on its being there.
For this we first utility function `checktree', defined in
quarkpy.maputils.py, which tests whether one object is
inside another.
What we want to do is, at some strategic point, make sure that
the tagged face (the thing sitting in editor.tagging.tagged)
is still sitting in the map structure (inside editor.Root).
We can do this with a little function `checktagged', defined
inside of tagfinishdrawing, right after we've gotten the tagged
face, which we then check the value of before proceeding:
<div class="doccode"><pre>
    ...
    tagged = gettagged(editor)
    if tagged is None: return
</pre></div>
<div class="doccode"><pre>
    def checktagged(tagged=tagged, editor=editor):
        if not checktree(editor.Root, tagged):
            cleartag(editor)
            return 0
        return 1
</pre></div>
<div class="doccode"><pre>
    if tagged is None or not checktagged():
        return
    ...
</pre></div>
This function utilizes the extremely useful technique of `default
arguments, in the definition of the function, the variables to
the right of the equalities in the function's argument-list
are evaluated in the context where
the function is defined, and then used as the values of the
variables on the left in subsequent calls.  Here the usage
of this technique is trivial,
just making an `if' statement a bit shorter, but things can get
more serious.  It would also seem to be a good idea to get rid
of the tagging attribute when it's useless; this is accomplished
by the `cleartag' function that's invoked above and defined here:
<div class="doccode"><pre>
def cleartag(editor):
    try:
       del editor.tagging
    except (AttributeError):
       pass
</pre></div>
Now as a pleasant side effect of all this,
when we move the tagged side, the Glue item should become
disabled on the menu.
</p><p>Finally, as an easy exercise, you should implement a `Clear tag&quot;
command.  Sample final results in &nbsp;<tt>maptagside3.py</tt>&nbsp;.
