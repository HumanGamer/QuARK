<p>Quake Army Knife (QuArK) is a multi-purpose tool for the games using engines
similar to or based on the Quake engine by id software. QuArK has the ability to
directly edit maps, and to a limited extent, models, and can import, export and convert
sounds, textures and various other game assets. It is also able to modify .pak
and .pk3  files, as well as importing compiled BSP's in order to study the
entities as well as add/change/delete entities from these files. No other game
editing tool available has the ability to do all of these things.
</p><p>QuArK is completely different from the desktop publishing program
Quark.

<p>QuArK was programmed by Armin Rigo while he was a mathematics student in Lausanne
Switzerland. Armin had been programming Quake related utilities since Quake's
release, and was the first one to release a program (DEACC) for de-compiling
Quake scripts in order to study their structure.  He later produced a map editor
called QuakeMap, which was then combined with DEACC and other tools to become
QuArK.  Armin has moved on from game-related programming and is now no longer
involved in QuArK or any other game-related activities.</p>

<p>QuArK was originally called QuakeMap, and was a map-only editor for Quake. QuakeMap broke
with the &quot;traditional&quot; 3-view (xy, xz, yz) interface and opted to go for a much simpler to
understand interface that showed just a &quot;side&quot; and &quot;top&quot; view, with a &quot;compass&quot; that rotated
your level through 360 degrees, making the third &quot;view&quot; unnecessary. This opened up much of
the screen real estate, and by incorporating a small uncluttered toolbar on the left hand
side, along with extensive right-click functionality, this enabled new users to quickly and
easily learn the interface enough to put their efforts into their creations, and not into
learning the editor and it's complicated arrays of views and tool buttons.
</p><p>As Armin expanded the program, it progressed to the point where Quake&quot;map&quot; was
no longer representative of its scope. The name was changed to Quake Army
Knife (QuArK for short) which better signified it's &quot;all-in-one&quot; abilities.
</p><p>QuArK expanded to integrate all of it's various editors and abilities into a single
interface called the QuArK Explorer that allows you to control most game assets
and to seamlessly integrate any and all of these items into a single QuArK file with the
extension &quot;.QRK&quot;. Items can be added, removed, and changed at will, and this means that your
past projects can be included in your future projects, simply by &quot;linking&quot; to the .QRK file
that contains them. All of your current items are shown in the Explorer, and managing the
items is a simple as clicking on an entry.
</p><p>As Armin approached the end of his undergraduate work, he foresaw that he would no
longer have the time to continue QuArK development, and released the source code
under the GPL, and begin to help various enthusiasts to begin to learn to maintain and extend it.
</p><p>It is now
maintained at SourceForge as the project <a href=http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/quark>
QuArK</a>, and has expanded its scope from just Quake to 15 different games
at time of writing (maybe more by the time you are reading this).

<p>One difference between QuArK and many other editors is a consistent
emphasis on an easy-to-use and intuitive interface, with extensive
flyover hints and other forms of in-program documentation.  No need
to remember 50 combinations of hot keys to produce a map.  Initial
configuration is simply a matter of filling in fields indicating where
the games you're editing and their compiling tools are located, and when
you start the map editor for the first time, you're presented with a
basic map than you can run by hitting the 'GO' button.
</p><p>There has also been extensive development of tools such as 'duplicators'
and 'shape builders' to help in creating complex patterns such as stairs,
arches and other sophisticated architecture.  If you know you need a row
of pillars but can't make up your mind about what texture to use on them,
you can use a duplicator, and changing the texture on the original will
automatically update the copies.
</p><p>A final difference is that QuArK is as far as we know the only GPL (Gnu Public
License) game editor that is being actively developed, and is easy to extend to
accomodate a wide range of different games.  The GPL means, among other things,
that the QuArK developers can't impose any restrictions at all on what
you do with it, unlike editors supported by games companies, which can't
be used for games produced by other companies.  So if you are an aspiring
game-developer you can adapt QuArK for your own project, without
having to reveal editor source until you release the editing tools for
your game (actually you don't even have to do that, though we would certainly
hope that you would).

ask for it.  If nothing happens after six months or so, bring it up
again; QuArK was developed by a different person then the present

<p>That depends.  If the game is a Quake 1/2/3 engine game, it might happen
pretty quickly if you ask.  If it's a non-Quake engine 'corridor shooter'
(Unreal, Serious Sam, Max Payne), it would depend on how much of the work
you are able and willing to do.  It's fair to say that the QuArK coders do
not have time to fossick around in forums and web sites collecting technical
specifications and map format information, so if you can do that and present
a nice package, that would improve the chances (there's also the issue of
whether the game developers themselves impose restrictions on editing
their content).
</p><p>If it's a landscape-based game such as Giants, the answer is probably no
(nullpointer at  <a href=http://www.planetcitizenkabuto.com>
http://www.planetcitizenkabuto.com</a> is planning to extend his
GiantsEdit to cover more games of that nature).

game, post on the <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/quark-python">
