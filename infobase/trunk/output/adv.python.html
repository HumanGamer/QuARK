QuArK is written in.  The `minipy' that you had to download and
compile to run QuArK at all includes a Python compiler, so
all you have to do to change to the python code is edit
a *.py file in a text editor, save it, and run QuArK:
compilation of changed .py files into .pyc files is automatic.
</p><p>If you want to develop in Python however, you will probably
want the full distribution from
<a href="http://www.python.org">www.python.org</a>, since this includes documentation including
a tutorial, command-line listener for testing out what functions do, etc.

<LI><strong> Learn Python in 24 Hours</strong>

    it could be used by absolute newbie programmers, since it
    seems to introduce basic programming concepts from scratch.
    HINT HINT: if some reader of this is an absolute newbie
    programmer, their reactions to this book would be useful

<p>Since Python is interpreted, its class system is far more
flexible than C++ or Delphi, and you can do stuff that you
can't even dream of in these languages (some of which is
very useful for GUI-building).  The downside of being
interpreted is that it's relatively slow.
</p><p>So things that need to be fast are coded in Delphi, and made available
to be called as functions in the Python.  These are both
functions and procedures called as part of the module
<strong>quarkx</strong>, and also attributes and methods
of map objects such as faces, poly's etc. that are defined
in the Delphi code, but need to be accessed from the Python
code as well.
</p><p>All of the Delphi-defined stuff is all documented in
<a href="src.quarkx.html">'QuarkX'</a> which is a fine reference manual.  The Delphi-defined
stuff integrates very smoothly into Python, and looks native.
So if you can't find a method-name in the Python code,
check the delphi, starting with the quarkx module.
</p><p>Although your first Python project will probably be a plugin,
you'll need to use not only quarkx, but also perhaps some of
the facilities in the module <strong>quarkpy</strong>, where
many basic facilities are also defined.  Unfortunately the
contents of quarkpy aren't very well cataloged. Info about
this, such as it is, is in <a href="adv.quarkpy.html">'QuarkPy'</a>.

<p><strong>QuarkX functions &amp; None</strong>:
If you write something like:
<div class="doccode"><pre>
    if quarkx.function():
      blah
      blah
</pre></div>
</p><p>expecting blah blah to not execute when function()
returns None as a value, you'll probably get a bizarre
run-time error.  Instead write:
</p><div class="doccode"><pre>
    if quarkx.function() is not None:
      blah
      blah
</pre></div>

<p>This is because most of the Python objects implemented in
Delphi do not explicitely support 'truth' evaluation.
Armin thought the Python core would detect it but it
seems it just tries to do the evaluation anyway, thus
calling a Nil function. Everything in Python can be true
or false, including the Delphi-defined objects -- at least
the Python core expects it so, and the Delphi code doesn't
do it right :-(  So always explicitely compare with None.
</p><p><strong>Vector equality</strong>:
Don't try to compare Quarkx vectors with equality,
rather test their difference for being zero.  Armin discusses
this in the <a href="src.quarkx.html">'QuarkX'</a> document.
</p><p><strong>Tuples &amp; assigment</strong>:
Python has a concept of `tuple', which is a sequence of numbers whose members can't
be changed (they're `immutable').  1-element tuples are
written with a comma after them, which leads to wierd
looking things like:
<div class="doccode"><pre>
  mytuple = mynumber,
</pre></div>
and
<div class="doccode"><pre>
  mynumber, = mytuple
</pre></div>
</p><p>This latter is an example of `tuple assignment', if the right
hand side of an assignemt is a tuple, then on the left hand side
you can put a tuple-expression, and the appropriate assignments
will get made to its variables.
</p><p>These commas are a bit unusual and easy to miss at first, and
since many of the most useful specifics in dialog boxes
are of tuple-type, missing them can lead to a lot of frustration.
</p><p><strong>Tabs &amp; whitespace</strong>:
One of Python's distinctive features is `whitespace structuring', whereby all members of
the same block have to be indented the same distance, and
sub-blocks are indented more.  This saves hunting around for
matching curlies, but can lead to at least one kind of
serious screwup, involving tabs:  if Python's idea of what
a tab is different from your editors, you can screw up
functioning code just by saving it.  I have my text editor
set to convert all tabs to 4 spaces.
