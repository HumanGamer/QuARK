I presume you have deleted the default room completly, because we need a blank
sheet in this section.
</p><p>A <a href="glossary.html#b">brush</a> is like a brick. You use them to build floors, walls and
ceilings with.
Even the sky and water are build with brushes. The word &nbsp;<tt>brush</tt>&nbsp; is not
really a good word, but it has become commonly known as; &quot;the object with which
to build levels with, for a <a href="glossary.html#q">Quake-engine</a> game&quot;. QuArK also uses the word
<a href="glossary.html#p">polyhedron</a> or the shorter <a href="glossary.html#p">poly</a>, to indicate a brush. You may even
see the word <a href="glossary.html#c">cube</a>, but it is still a brush/polyhedron.
</p><p>So to create a brush, click on the icon shown in the image. This will create a
cube with a <a href="intro.configuration.map.html#building">'default size'</a> and
<a href="intro.configuration.games.html">'default texture'</a> in your map.
</p><p>Your new brush will be shown as selected in the 2D-views, by showing it in
<a href="intro.configuration.map.html#colors">'a shade of blue'</a> and with movement
handles.

You can move a brush, by moving your mouse to the black-handle in the center
(polyhedron handle), press and hold the mouse button, then move the brush to a
new position, and release the mouse button.
</p><p>To size the brush, use the small blue-handles at the edges (<a href="glossary.html#f">face</a>
handles.)
</p><p>To distort a corner, use the <a href="glossary.html#v">vertex</a>. Notice that QuArK does not distort
just a single corner, but an <a href="glossary.html#e">edge</a>. This is due to the internal storing of
faces, and in many cases ensure that your brushes are kept <a href="glossary.html#c">convex</a>, which
they must be to be used in a Quake-engine game! True vertex-manipulation does
not exists in QuArK.
</p><p>Try to create some more brushes, and move them around, maybe even size them.
You can unselect the brush(es) by clicking in an empty space of the 2D-views,
and selecting them again by clicking within the brush. Notice that the
<a href="intro.mapeditor.dataforms.html#treeview">'Tree-view (hierarchy-view)'</a> will show you your new cubes,
where you also can select them.
</p><p>Try also to delete and <a href="maped.tutorial.starting.html#undoredo">'undo/redo'</a> your
newly created brushes.

Say you have a lot of brushes on top of each other, which from one of the
2D-views makes it look like only one brush is visible, as shown in the image.
</p><p>How would you select the second brush, if you only were allowed to click in the
2D-view, which showed only <i>one</i>&nbsp; brush?
</p><p>Simple, keep on mouse-clicking.
</p><p>QuArK has this functionality, that if you click a second time on a selected
brush, it searches for another brush which lies deeper 'into the screen' so to
say. If one can be found, it will be selected.
</p><p>Try it out. Make some cubes, and place them as shown in the image. Then try to
select them one by one, by clicking in the 2D-view which displays only
<i>one</i>&nbsp; of the cubes.

It would be quite a dull level, if you only used one <a href="glossary.html#t">texture</a>. So how do
we change the texture on a brush?
</p><p>First the brush(es) must be selected. When they are selected, the
<a href="intro.mapeditor.dataforms.html#polyhedronview">'Polyhedron-view'</a> will appear
instead of the tree-view, showing you some information about the selected
brush(es) and the texture, as shown in the image.
</p><p>To change the texture on the whole brush, press on the choose texture
icon <img width=24 height=22 align=absmiddle src="maped.tutorial.polyhedrons.image12.png">, or right-click
on the brush to get a context menu up, where you can select &nbsp;<tt>Texture...</tt>&nbsp;
</p><p>In the <a href="intro.texturebrowser.html">'texture-browser'</a>, you can
browse (wow!) through the available textures, and select the one you want
assigned to the brush(es). You select a texture by double-clicking on it, in
the texture-browser.
</p><p></td></tr>

</p><p><img width=170 height=238 align=right src="maped.tutorial.polyhedrons.image13.png">
To change the texture on just one face, you select the face by clicking on its
face-handle. The same handle you used to size the brush with.
You will see that the <a href="intro.mapeditor.dataforms.html#faceview">'Face-view'</a> now
appears instead of the polyhedron-view.
</p><p>Again, to change the texture, press on the choose texture icon
<img width=25 height=23 align=absmiddle src="maped.tutorial.polyhedrons.image14.png">, or right-click on
the face-handle to get a context menu up, where you can select
&nbsp;<tt>Texture...</tt>&nbsp;
</p><p>This should be enough introduction for you, to mess around with texturing the
rest of your cubes. Try also to assign different textures to each face of a
cube, and see what happens.

<p>Now you have learned enough to make your first room. So go ahead. Do it. :-)
</p><p>Maybe a little help on the way? Well, okay then:
<ul>
<li>Start by creating a cube, size it so it forms the floor of the room. Texture it as you like.
<li>Next create yet a cube, size it as the first one, but make this the ceiling. Texture it.
<li>Now create 4 cubes, size and position them so they become the walls of your room. Texture them too.

are you going to know what brush are related to what?
</p><p>This is where <a href="glossary.html#g">groups</a> are used. You can group together, those brushes and
entities which, e.g. belongs to a single room, an advanced multi-segmented
door, a vehicle which consists of many brushes, etc.
</p><p>To group brushes and entities, you first <a href="maped.tutorial.starting.html#deleting">'select'</a>
the ones which should be grouped together. Then you press the
<a href="intro.mapeditor.misctools.html#newgroup">'new group'</a> icon

Try to group your 6 brushes, which is your room. The tree-view should show you
something similar as shown in this image:
</p><p>You can of cause give the group a more meaningful name, by selecting the
group-object, and press the F2 key, or slowly double-clicking on it. (Just like
in Windows' File-Explorer.)
</p><p>I suggest you rename your newly created group to: &nbsp;<tt>My first room</tt>&nbsp;.
</p><p>There are some special things you can do with groups, but that is explained in
the <a href="maped.tutorial.advanced.html#grouptechniques">'Group techniques'</a>. However, if you are curious, just
right-click on the group-object, to get its context-menu up.
