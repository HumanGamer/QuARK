title: Suggestions
author: tiglari, etc.

Suggestions for implementation (proposer parenthesized).  Ideally these
should be sorted into <ref>plans/q65</ref>, <ref>plans/unlikely</ref>
or <ref>plans/bigideas</ref>, but for some reason or other I can't make up
my mind today.

<UL>
<LI>Path info for file links, so that the files can be anywhere (Seth)

<LI>Rescale textures on vertex drag (rd, currently in exp. plugin).

<LI>Selected groups colored rather than dotted outline (option perhaps?). (rd)

<li>Patch-based terrain builder: (tiglari)

<li>New projection option, 
'project from nearest plane', emulating classic qe texture
alignment: the projection of the texture scale on the closest
axis plane to the tagged face normal is found, then that is
projected onto the tagged face. (tiglari)

<li>Optional plugins:
<br>Some plugins wouldn't load unless they were 'registered'
like addons; this would make it easier to try things out
<br>Alternative: plugins with 'expmap', etc. prefixes which
would only load when a 'load experimental plugins' option was
checked.

<li>Red-hot keys:
<br>'T', 'W' etc in 3d view would select & tag/wrap etc the
visible face they were over. (tiglari, quantum red)

<li>Intersection finder:
<br>A ripoff of the one in bobtoolz

<li>Autocaulker:
<br>Ditto
</UL>
