author: tiglari, etc.

Suggestions for implementation (proposer parenthesized).
<UL>
<LI>Preserve selected status for face & brush on vertex move (rd)

<LI>Path info for file links, so that the files can be anywhere (Seth)

<LI>Rescale textures on vertex drag (rd, currently in exp. plugin).

<LI>Selected groups colored rather than dotted outline (option perhaps?). (rd)

<LI>Texture rescale on vertex drag to preserve alignment (rd)

<li>Patch-based terrain builder: (tiglari)

<li>Adquedit-equivalent resource display: (Seth)

<li> new projection option, 
'project from nearest plane', emulating classic qe texture
alignment: the projection
of the texture scale on the closest axis plane to the tagged
face normal is found, then that is projected onto the tagged
face. (tiglari)

<li>Optional plugins:
<br>Some plugins wouldn't load unless they were 'registered'
like addons; this would make it easier to try things out
(tiglari)
