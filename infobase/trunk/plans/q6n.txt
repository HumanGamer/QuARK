title: QuArK 6.?
author: tiglari, etc.

These features are envisioned for the future, with
no specific target release (might be put off, might
be brought forward).

<ul>

<li>Model editor: (Andy, tiglari)
<br>  export closed mesh to brushset

<li>persistent edits: (?)
<br> undo/redo info written to files/saved with maps,
supporting playable entity demos (Ax2grind idea),
and 'orthogonal persistence' (http://www.tunes.org)
of editing sessions

<li>XML support: (?)
<br>Maximum possible compatibility with GtkRadiant

<li>Brush primitives: (?)
<br>Some internal use (suggestion: use
axis base coord system with threepoints[0] as
origin; should speed up writing to bp format)

<li>Big XY view: (?)
<br> whole-screen XY view, with other stuff on RMB's

<li>Surf Inspectors: (?)
<br>Laid out more like in Radiant, which I like
better than Quark's long list.

</ul>
