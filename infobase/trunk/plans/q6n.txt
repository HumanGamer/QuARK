title: QuArK 6.?
author: tiglari, etc.

These features are envisioned for the future, with
no specific target release (might be put off, might
be brought forward, might be just tdfh).  Ranging
from the relatively straightforward to crazed dreams.

<ul>

<li>Model editor: (Andy, tiglari)
<br>  export closed mesh to brushset

<li>persistent edits: (?)
<br> undo/redo info written to files/saved with maps,
supporting playable entity demos (Ax2grind idea),
and 'orthogonal persistence' (http://www.tunes.org)
of editing sessions

<li>XML support: (?)
<br>Maximum possible compatibility with GtkRadiant

<li>Qrk editor: (?)
<br>Edit .qrk's in the style of a decent XML editor

<li>Brush primitives: (?)
<br>Some internal use (suggestion: use
axis base coord system with threepoints[0] as
origin; should speed up writing to bp format)

<li>Big XY view: (?)
<br> whole-screen XY view, with other stuff on RMB's

<li>Integrated Dynamic bsp builder: (?)
<br>bsp building & optimization while u're scratching
ur head...

<li>Surf Inspectors: (?)
<br>Laid out more like in Radiant, which I like
better than Quark's long list.

</ul>
