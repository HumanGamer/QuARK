title: Big Ideas
author: tiglari, etc.

Ambitious, not necessarily realistic proposals,  Ranging
from the relatively straightforward to crazed dreams.  More likely
as Quarkplusplus features.

<ul>

<li> Auto-binary qrk:
<br>When a text-based .qrk is loaded, write a binary format equivalent
with extenion .brk; then next time load that unless the .qrk is newer
(same logic as .py and .pyc).

<li>Model editor: (Andy, tiglari)
<br>  export closed mesh to brushset

<li> NetQuark: (???)
Multi-user editing over the net.  Would need somebody who
really knows what they're doing.  Probably not a
realistic target,  Support for collaboration via CVS might be
more plausible.

<li>persistent edits: (?)
<br> undo/redo info written to files/saved with maps,
supporting playable entity demos (Ax2grind idea),
and 'orthogonal persistence' (http://www.tunes.org)
of editing sessions

<li>XML support: (?)
<br>Maximum possible compatibility with GtkRadiant Xmap, which doesn't
seem to be going anywhere at the moment.  

<li>Qrk editor: (?)
<br>Edit .qrk's in the style of a decent XML editor
<br>Andy's form-editing extension to the explorer are basically
implementing this.


<li>Integrated Dynamic bsp builder: (?)
<br>bsp building & optimization while u're scratching
ur head...

<li>Surf Inspectors: (?)
<br>Laid out more like in Radiant, which I like
better than Quark's long list.

<li>More Game Formats: (?)
<br>Unreal engine, Serious Sam, Heroes of Might and Magic (Quark was
used some internally for either the one coming out now or the one
before it, so maybe this one has a chance).
</ul>
