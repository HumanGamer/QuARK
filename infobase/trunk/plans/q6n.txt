title: QuArK 6.?
author: tiglari, etc.

These features are envisioned for the future, with
no specific target release (might be put off, might
be brought forward, might be just tdfh).  Ranging
from the relatively straightforward to crazed dreams.

<ul>

<li>Model editor: (Andy, tiglari)
<br>  export closed mesh to brushset

<li> NetQuark: (???)
Multi-user editing over the net.  Would need somebody who
really knows what they're doing.  Probably not a
realistic target,

<li>persistent edits: (?)
<br> undo/redo info written to files/saved with maps,
supporting playable entity demos (Ax2grind idea),
and 'orthogonal persistence' (http://www.tunes.org)
of editing sessions

<li>XML support: (?)
<br>Maximum possible compatibility with GtkRadiant

<li>Qrk editor: (?)
<br>Edit .qrk's in the style of a decent XML editor
<br>Andy's form-editing extension to the explorer are basically
implementing this.

<li>Brush primitives: (?)
<br>Some internal use (suggestion: use
axis base coord system with threepoints[0] as
origin; should speed up writing to bp format)
<br>steps towards this in the NuTex branch.  Probably Not a
Good Idea.

<li>Big XY view: (?)
<br> whole-screen XY view, with other stuff on RMB's

<li>Integrated Dynamic bsp builder: (?)
<br>bsp building & optimization while u're scratching
ur head...

<li>Surf Inspectors: (?)
<br>Laid out more like in Radiant, which I like
better than Quark's long list.

<li>More Game Formats: (?)
<br>Unreal engine, Serious Sam, Heroes of Might and Magic (Quark was
used some internally for either the one coming out now or the one
before it, so maybe this one has a chance).
</ul>
