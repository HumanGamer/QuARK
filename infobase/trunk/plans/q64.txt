title: QuArK 6.4
author: tiglari, etc.

Here are some things that have been envisioned for 6.4, which I (tiglari)
hope will start pretty soon.  The stuff near the top of the list is more
likely to be done soon or at all than the stuff further down.  Keep in mind
that at some point the <a href=http://quarkplusplus.sourceforge.net/>
QuArKplusplus project</a> will overtake and subsume the development of
the current version of QuArK, possibly before some of the things on this
list are done.

<UL>
<li>Targetted and targetter finder: (tiglari)
<br> suggestion by quantum_red.

<li>Mixed-face contents finder: (tiglari)
<br> suggestion by funkiedamouse.

<li>Ripoff of WC `arch maker': (tiglari)
<br>would be called something like`arc builder', probably
basically a duplicator, emulating the wc thing's functionality.

<li>importable and exportable config info (some discussion of this
in early May2002 on quark-python)

<li>L-square menu enhancements: (tiglari, ax2grind)
<br>status: started, align & glue to tagged done.  I intend
to leave further enhancements as an exercise for someone who
wants to learn more about QuArK-Python programming.
Suggested additions are:
<UL>
<LI> checkbox for relative to tagged/join of L
(better to just tag the join, I think now)
<LI> move to fraction of distance to tagged (arm only)
<LI> end position
<LI> arm length
<LI> arm angle
</UL>
What about L-join options?

<li>Radiant-style Regioning: (?)
<br>Hide and don't save everything not in the rectangle.

<li> Edit textures in .bsp files: (Andy, tiglari, Decker, ?)
<br>an as-yet-unimplemented 4.7 feature.

<li>FAKK2 support: (?)
<br>And what about Daikatana?

<li>OsFolders: (tiglari)
<br>edit the properties of pre-existing OsFolders

<li>Brush-based shape-builders: (tiglari, Decker)
<br>'inner boxes' (two independently manipulable boxes, one inside
   the other, giving more control over arch shapes).
<br> redo prism-builder as shape-builder.
<br> more fancy options for stair-builder

<li>Patch-based shape-builders: (tiglari)
<br> sphere, 'inner boxes', 'square cylinders' (s/b easy, but no
requests for it

<li>Patch bend mode: (tiglari)
<br>Or something like it.

<li>full equivalence to GtkR patch texturing: (tiglari)

<li>Expand/Contract faces: (tiglari)
<br>As enhancement to experimental mapmovevertex plugin
<br>Plus extension of vertex locks to ordinary vertex dragging.

<li>CTF duplicator: (tiglari)
<br>status: started, nothing committed.

<li>Model Editor: (Andy)
<br>more progress

<li>Incorporate 'entity info files' into toolboxes: (tiglari)
<br>tiglari has PERL scripts that generate various kinds of info (hints, bounding
bpxes etc) from Radiant .def files and other sources, the idea being to
let these be automatically integrated into the toolboxes generated
by Andy's addon-builder.

<li>Map reconstructor for Q3 engine games: (tiglari)
<br>This might be easier to do well for Q3 engine
games because the model structure seems to include
brush info as well as face info.
<br>status: envisioned.
