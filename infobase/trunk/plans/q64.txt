title: QuArK 6.4
author: tiglari, etc.

Current plans for 6.4.  Some of the python-based facilities might become
available as experimental addons to 6.3

<UL>
<li>Read Q3/STVEF .bsp files: (Andy, tiglari, ?)
<br>Actually, totally reorganize bsp reading code

<li> Edit textures in .bsp files: (Andy, tiglari, Decker, ?)
<br>an as-yet-unimplemented 4.7 feature.

<li>FAKK2 support: (?)
<br>And what about Daikatana, Alice, & Gunman
<br>status: Gunman seems supportable as an add-on

<li>OsFolders: (tiglari)
<br>edit the properties of pre-existing OsFolders

<li>L-square menu enhancements: (tiglari, ?)
<br>status: started, align & glue to tagged done.  I intend
to leave further enhancements as an exercise for someone who
wants to learn more about QuArK-Python programming.
Suggested additions are:
<UL>
<LI> checkbox for relative to tagged/join of L
<LI> end position
<LI> arm length
<LI> arm angle
</UL>
What about L-join options?

<li>Brush-based shape-builders: (tiglari, Decker)
<br>'inner boxes' (two independently manipulable boxes, one inside
   the other, giving more control over arch shapes).
<br> redo prism-builder as shape-builder.
<br> more fancy options for stair-builder

<li>Patch-based shape-builders: (tiglari)
<br> sphere, 'inner boxes', 'square cylinders' (s/b easy, but no
requests for it

<li>Patch bend mode: (tiglari)
<br>Or something like it.

<li>full equivalence to GtkR patch texturing: (tiglari)
<br>If we're actually behind 

<li>Expand/Contract faces: (tiglari)
<br>As enhancement to experimental mapmovevertex plugin
<br>Plus extension of vertex locks to ordinary vertex dragging.

<li>CTF duplicator: (tiglari)
<br>status: started, nothing committed.

<li>Model Editor: (Andy)
<br>more progress

<li>Ripoff of WC `arch maker': (tiglari)
<br>would be called something like`arc builder', probably
basically a duplicator, emulating the wc thing's functionality.

<li>3point cutting plane: (tiglari)

<li>Incorporate 'entity info files' into toolboxes: (tiglari)
<br>tiglari has PERL scripts that generate various kinds of info (hints, bounding
bpxes etc) from Radiant .def files and other sources, the idea being to
let these be automatically integrated into the toolboxes generated
by Andy's addon-builder.
