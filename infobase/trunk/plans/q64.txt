title: QuArK 6.4
author: tiglari, etc.

These are what I (tiglari) judge to be serious ideas for QuArK 6.4,
which have a good chance of appearing progressively in snapshots over
the next year or so.  The stuff near the top of the list is more
likely to be done soon or at all than the stuff further down.  Keep in mind
that at some point the <a href=http://quarkplusplus.sourceforge.net/>
QuArKplusplus project</a> will overtake and subsume the development of
the current version of QuArK, possibly before some of the things on this
list are done.

<UL>
<LI>Leak line simplification:
<br> information from Bengt Jardrup:
<br>Tiglari, if you take a look at the Q1 compilers at my site 
<code>
> http://user.tninet.se/~xir870k , you'll find that both of them 
> already have a leak line "simplification" algorithm default active 
> that significantly reduces the leak trail length and complexity. As a 
> result, the .pts file size shrinks significantly. For large leaky 
> maps, this is an enormous advantage.
> 
> This algorithm was originally designed by Greg 'Tree' Lewis and 
> fixed/improved by Tyrann and me. The algorithm can be found in source 
> file outside.c and is called SimplifyLeakline.

<li>bot waypoint editor: (decker)
<br>status: limited implementation as plugin.

<li>Flexible vertex movement: (tiglari)
<br>status: some ideas about how to do it.

<li>Targetted and targetter finder: (tiglari)
<br> suggestion by quantum_red.
<br>status: preliminary plugin in quark groups files/Plugins area.

<li>Mixed-face contents finder: (tiglari)
<br> suggestion by funkiedamouse.

<li>More flexible greyout: (suggestion by quantum red)
<br>Provide an option so that things are selectable when
visible in only one view.

<li>Patch bend mode: (tiglari)
<br>Or something like it, and other patch-handling extensions.

<li>Ripoff of WC `arch maker': (tiglari)
<br>would be called something like`arc builder', probably
basically a duplicator, emulating the wc thing's functionality.

<Li>Finish spport for Mohaa: (tiglari)
<br>Needs info about lod terrain format, model format and where
the entity editing info is stored.

<li>A Radiant-style XY view with vertical Z window: (tiglari)
<br>The justification being that that gives maximal screen real estate
for the top-down view (if you think about it, it's an extreme development
of the Classic QuArK view).

<li>importable and exportable config info (some discussion of this
in early May2002 on quark-python)

<li>L-square menu enhancements: (tiglari, ax2grind)
<br>status: started, align & glue to tagged done.  I intend
to leave further enhancements as an exercise for someone who
wants to learn more about QuArK-Python programming.
Suggested additions are:
<UL>
<LI> checkbox for relative to tagged/join of L
(better to just tag the join, I think now)
<LI> move to fraction of distance to tagged (arm only)
<LI> end position
<LI> arm length
<LI> arm angle
</UL>
What about L-join options?

<li>Radiant-style Regioning: (?)
<br>Hide and don't write to map everything not in the rectangle.

<li>Tag side plugin: (tiglari)
<br>More flexibility for wrap across tagged.

<li>Brush-based shape-builders: (tiglari, Decker)
<br>'inner boxes' (two independently manipulable boxes, one inside
   the other, giving more control over arch shapes).
<br> redo prism-builder as shape-builder.
<br> more fancy options for stair-builder

<li>Patch-based shape-builders: (tiglari)
<br> sphere, 'inner boxes', 'square cylinders' (s/b easy, but no
requests for it)

<li>full equivalence to GtkR patch texturing: (tiglari)

<li>Expand/Contract faces: (tiglari)
<br>As enhancement to experimental mapmovevertex plugin
<br>Plus extension of vertex locks to ordinary vertex dragging.

<li>CTF duplicator: (tiglari)
<br>status: started, nothing committed.

<li>Model Editor: (Andy, tiglari?)
<br>more progress

<li>Incorporate 'entity info files' into toolboxes: (tiglari)
<br>tiglari has PERL scripts that generate various kinds of info (hints, bounding
bpxes etc) from Radiant .def files and other sources, the idea being to
let these be automatically integrated into the toolboxes generated
by Andy's addon-builder.
