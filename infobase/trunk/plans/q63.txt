title: QuArK 6.3
author: tiglari, etc.

This is stuff that tiglari currently envisions for the next release of
QuArK.  Needless to say, highly non-definitive! I think I've put my
name on more than I can get around to doing for a timely release.

<ul>
<li>Read Q3/STVEF .bsp files: (Andy, tiglari, ?)
<br>Actually, totally reorganize bsp reading code

<li> Edit textures in .bsp files: (Andy, tiglari, Decker, ?)
<br>an as-yet-unimplemenated 4.7 feature.

<li> Write WC3.3 map format: (tiglari)

<li>Model Editor: (Andy)
<br>more progress

<li>MipTex Extraction: (tiglari,Andy)
<br>Get the add-on builder to handle Q1, Hx2 properly

<li>Linear Matrix editor: (tiglari)
<br>crank out matrices for rotation, scaling
etc. from intelligible parameters (from pushbutton in duplicator
forms).

<li>OsFolders: (tiglari)
<br>edit the properties of pre-existing OsFolders

<li>Brush-based shape-builders: (tiglari, Decker)
<br> 'thick', and 'inner boxes' (more control over arch shapes)
<br> redo prism-builder as shape-builder.
<br> more fancy options for stair-builder

<li>'Instance' duplicator: (tiglari)
<br> put copies of a structure where you want it.  Inspired
by a suggestion by Meatball402 on Quake3World editing forum.
<br>status: basic version committed.  Working on integration with
path duplicator.

<li>Patch-based shape-builders: (tiglari)
<br> sphere, 'inner boxes'

<li>FAKK2 support: (?)
<br>And what about Daikatana, Alice, & the new HL-based
Wild West game?

<li>User-configurable hot keys: (tiglari)
<br>status: current ones all done.  What additional ones
should be added?

<li>User-specifible rotation/linear mapping origin: (tiglari)
<br>Do they really need to be persistent properties of groups?
(as opposed say to a tagged point)
<br>what about axis?

<li>Optional plugins: (tiglari)
<br>Some plugins wouldn't load unless they were 'registered'
like addons; this would make it easier to try things out

<li>Expand/Contract faces: (tiglari)
<br>As enhancement to experimental mapmovevertex plugin

<li>Tag side plugin: (tiglari)
<br>More flexibility for wrap across tagged.
<br>project from nearest plane', emulating classic qe texture
alignment: the projection
of the texture scale on the closest axis plane to the tagged
face normal is found, then that is projected onto the tagged
face.

<li>Ripoff of WC `arch maker': (tiglari)
<br>would be called something like`arc builder', probably
basically a duplicator, emulating the wc thing's functionality.

<li>3point cutting plane: (tiglari)

<li>Face-selection modes: (tiglari)

<li>Patch-based terrain builder: (tiglari, Seth?)

<li>L-square enhancements: (tiglari, ax2grind)

<li>Adquedit-equivalent resource display: (Andy, ?)

<li>CTF duplicator: (tiglari)
<br>Maybe too complicated?

</ul>
