title: QuArK 6.3
author: tiglari, etc.

This is stuff that tiglari and anyone else who updates this
file currently envisions for the next release of
QuArK.  Considerable material has just been put off from 6.3 to 6.4

<ul>
<li>Linear Matrix editor: (tiglari, lots of design from Rolf Hulsbergen)
<br>crank out matrices for rotation, scaling
etc. from intelligible parameters (from pushbutton in duplicator
forms).
<br>status: re-done.

<li>Extruder: (tiglari)
<br>generate brushes etc. from 2d outlines.
<br>status: done (integrates with path duplicator); some extensions
currently being added.

<li>'New Copy One' duplicator: (tiglari)
<br> put copies of a structure where you want it.  Inspired
by a suggestion by Meatball402 on Quake3World editing forum.
<br>status: done, replaces previous 'instance duplicator' idea.

<li>User-configurable hot keys: (tiglari)
<br>status: current ones all done.
<br>What additional ones should be added?

<li>User-specifible rotation/linear mapping origin: (tiglari)
<br>Do they really need to be persistent properties of groups?
(as opposed say to a tagged point)
<br>what about axis? No, wouldn't integrate with the buttons.
<br>status: redone as handle (old origin duplicator removed
from interface).  Works as fixpoint for scale/rotate linear specifics
in some duplicators.

<li>Merge Polys: (tiglari)
<br>bugs fixed, merge all mergeable polys in group
<br>status: done

<li>Form-editing: (Andy)
<br>status: create capacity done.

<li> Entity Extractor: (Andy)
<br> Entities extracted from .bsp's in many formats
    (including Q3(T)A).
<br> Status: done, runs out of memory on some maps in some .pk3's.
This can be worked around by extracting the .bsps to individual
files.

<li>Face-selection modes: (tiglari)
<br>status: done, as 'F' during RMB click.

<li>L-square enhancements: (tiglari, ax2grind)
<br>status: started, align & glue to tagged done.  I intend
to leave further enhancements as an exercise for someone who
wants to learn more about QuArK-Python programming.

<LI>Tree navigation: (tiglari, design from Decker, realdespair)
<br> home, pg up, pg down for parent, next prev in group, cycling.
Plus some kind of option for getting next-of-same-type in group.
<br>status: basic stuff done.  Perhaps add more refined same-type
option (=classname for point entities, brush entities, =macro
for duplicators)

<li> Entity Lump Extractor: (tiglari)
<br> extracts entity lumps from .bsp's in a .pak to independent files.
<br> status: done but seems to fail with STVEF .bsp's whose names
begin with underscore.  More thought about easy preparation of
entity addons is needed.

<li>3point cutting plane: (tiglari)
<br>status: done

<li>Pythonify entity def converters: (Andy)
<br>status: done

<li>texture search facility: (Andy, suggestions from quantum_red)
<br>status: done

<li>storable camera positions: (tiglari, design from quantum_red)
<br>status: done

<li>group selection movement commands: (tiglari, design from Alan Donald and quantum_red)
<br>exchange position & align (WC-style)
<br>status:done

<li>incrementable specifics in duplicators: (subnoodle, tiglari)
<br>status: done except for radial duplicator.

<li>promotion/demotion of submenus: (tiglari)
<br>status: done for texture & tagging (not intended
for all submenus, just some of the more useful ones)

<li>Support for pythonified entity converters: (Andy)
<br>status: done for fgd2qrk

<li>Code specifics for toolbar buttons: (Andy)
<br>status: done

<li>Support for Gunman, Blue Shift & other HL derivatives: (Decker)
<br>status: done

<li>Tag side plugin: (tiglari)
<br>More flexibility for wrap across tagged.
<br>status: the only thing on this list which isn't reasonably far
along or just plain done.

</ul>
