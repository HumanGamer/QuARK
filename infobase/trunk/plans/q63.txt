title: QuArK 6.3
author: tiglari, etc.

This is stuff that tiglari currently envisions for the next release
of QuArK.  Needless to say, highly non-definitive!

<ul>
<li>Read Q3/STVEF .bsp files: (Andy, tiglari, ?)
<br>Actually, totally reorganize bsp reading code

<li>Path Duplicator: (Decker, tiglari)
<br>Dialogs for making arcs etc.
<br>status: started

<li>OsFolders: (tiglari)
<br>    edit the properties of pre-existing OsFolders

<li>Brush-based shape-builders: (tiglari)
<br> 'thick', and 'inner boxes' (more control over arch shapes)
<br> redo prism-builder as shape-builder.

<li>Patch-based shape-builders: (tiglari)
<br> sphere, 'inner boxes'

<li>FAKK2 support: (?)

<li>User-configurable hot keys: (tiglari)
<br>status: started; how many functions should have hot keys,
should they all be U.C.?

<li>Tag side plugin: (tiglari)
<br>More flexibility for wrap across tagged.

<li>Face-selection modes: (tiglari)

<li>Patch-based terrain builder: (tiglari, Seth?)

<li>L-square enhancements: (tiglari, ax2grind)

<li>Adquedit-level resource display: (Andy, ?)

<li>CTF duplicator: (tiglari)
<br>Maybe too complicated?

</ul>
