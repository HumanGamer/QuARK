title: QuArK 6.2 (current)
author: tiglari

Stuff actually implemented in QuArK 6.2.  Perhaps
somebody could produce accurate lists for 6.0
and 6.1?

<ul>

<li>Q3(T)A Model display: (Andy/Maleficus)
<br> Complex models now showing

<li>OsFolders: (tiglari)
<br> Load up resources from disk by specified paths etc.
Editing of folder properties not yet implemented, maybe delay til 6.3

<li>Bezier Page: (tiglari)
<br>No 'cp picking' or linear mapping handles.

<li>Bezier CP Picking: (tiglari)
<br>Select certain cp's & operate on them only. (in map views, not
bezier page)

<li>Read/Write Brush Primitives: (tiglari)
<br>There's a potential for imprecisions to accumulate if
stuff is imported & exported multiple times/


<li>Read Worlcraft 3.3 Map format: (tiglari)
<br>No writing yet.  So Quark is now among other things a
WC3.3->standard format map converter.

<li>DefaultTextureScale: (tiglari)
<br>Only for the buttons, don't yet understand how
to do it for direct insert from toolbox menu.

<li>Path duplicator: (Decker, tiglari)
<br>With tiling substructures, 'elbow spaces', point position/creation
dialogs, `roll control'.

<li>Patch-based shape builders: (tiglari)
<br>New orientations.

<li>Brush-based shape builders: (tiglari)
<br>No 'thick' yet.  Same orientations as patch-based ones.

<li>Stairway duplicator: (Decker)
<br>Stairs in a box

<li>Microbrush H/K: (tiglari)
<br> Find and destroy.

<li>New Games/Addons Supported:
<br>STVEF (Alex)
<br>Q3TA (Maleficus, Andy)
<br>Crystal Space (Desmond Fletcher, et. al.)  This one probably
needs more work from somebody knowledgeable about CS.

<li>Drag & Drop imprecision bug: (tiglari)
<br>squashed.

<li>Model editor: (Andy)
<br>pre-alpha Q1/2

<li>'texture pinning': (tiglari)
<br>Position a texture by giving its coords at three points

<li>sprites etc. display: (Andy).
<br> Display assorted minor resources. Full Adquedit not
yet there.

<li>Look At on face menu: (tiglari)
<br>moves & points the camera in an open
3d view to look head on at the face (ctrl to view from backside)

<li>`radial' duplicator: (tiglari)
<br>Makes copies of things
radially around a tiltable axis, with 'spiral' attributes.

<li> Entity Extractor: (Andy)
<br> Entities extracted from .bsp's in many formats
    (including Q3(T)A).
    
<li> fgd converter: (Andy, Decker)

<li> tag side plugin: (tiglari)
<br> Wrap texture across tagged might be less fussy
    
<li> Navigate Tree: (tiglari)
<br>    Zoom now causes 3d view camera to swivel to object

<li> Addon organization: (Decker)
<br>   Addons now can go in a different folder for each game.
   
<li> Circlestrafe Selection Mouse-key combo: (tiglari)
<br> Shift+RMB during drag to swivel around selected
object.


</ul>
