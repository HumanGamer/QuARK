Then the game will need a <tt>:config</tt> and <tt>:form</tt> section in the file Defaults.qrk,
grouped with the <tt>:config</tt> and <tt>:form</tt> sections for
the games already supported.  Please place them in alphabetical order 
so they will show up on the Games menu and config sections that way. This
allows for easier and more consistency in the positioning of these items.

People usually copy the ones for the game that is most similar
to the new one, and then change whatever needs to be changed.
You should pick a recognizable abbreviation and use it consistently,
e.g. SoF2 for Soldier of Fortune 2.

Also, the game needs to be added to the "<tt>QuakeCtx:form</tt>-group <tt>Game</tt>-sub-group <tt>Items</tt>-variable" list (in Defaults.qrk).
