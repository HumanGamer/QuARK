Here is a quick overview of how to support a new game; if the game uses
pretty much the same tech as one that QuArK already supports, this might
be enough, otherwise you might actually have learn something about how
QuArK works.

But first, before actually doing anything, post to one of the
QuArK yahoo groups, or if you for some reason can't do that, email Decker
or tiglari to say what you want to do, in case somebody is already doing it.
