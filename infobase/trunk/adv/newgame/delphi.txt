title: Delphi coding

At the minimum, there will have to be a gamecode for the game, defined
in the source file prog/Setup.pas.  Presently these are single-character alphanumerics
assigned on the basis of what kind of engine is used:
<UL>
<LI>1-9: Quake 1/HL</LI>
<LI>A-Z: Quake 2</LI>
<LI>a-z: Quake 3 & other advanced</LI>
</UL>
Engines that do use shaders and might acquire curves should go into the
last range (Quake 3 & other advanced).

If the game has technology similar to one already supported by QuArK, then this
may well be all that's necessary, and one of the current Delphi coders
will be able to do it for you.  Otherwise there may need to be coding for
texture-display, model-viewing, terrain editing etc., and you might have
to do some or even most of it yourself.
