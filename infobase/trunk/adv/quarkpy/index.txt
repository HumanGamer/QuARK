title: QuarkPy
subdir: organization gui

Quarkpy is the module, composed of the files in the quarkpy
subfolder, which provides both the basic facilities that
Python provides for the Delphi code, and also the basic
facilities that plugins depend on and add to.

It can be thought of as a big and as yet poorly documented API;
learning your way around it is one of the biggest obstacle to
getting good at QuArK Python coding.

Hopefully the rather paltry info here will be augmented
before too long.
