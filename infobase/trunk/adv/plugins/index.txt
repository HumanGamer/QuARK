<P>Plug-Ins are scripts programmed in Python that modify
existing features or add new features to QuArK. They
are mainly related to the map editor, which is itself
programmed mostly in Python.

<P>Probably the best way to get a feel for plugins is to
first work thru a tutorial, then look at some existing
examples.
