title: Hot Keys
author: tiglari

Our last topic is something that's easy for us, but was very
hard for Armin to implement, he says, `hot keys'.  These are
keys you can press to get an action instead of going thru the
tedium of finding the relevant menu & the item on it.  Here's
how to set up a hot key:
<code>
quarkpy.mapcommands.shortcuts["Ctrl+T"] = mentagside
quarkpy.mapcommands.shortcuts["Ctrl+G"] = menglueside
</code>
If you've been reading up on Python, you'll perceive that
`shortcuts' is just a `dictionary' (hash table, for techos)
attached to the mapcommands object, and we're just sticking
the menu items into it, indexed by string
codes for their hotkeys.  Then some code in quarkpy, of which
we will all hopefully be able to remain
blissfully ignorant, gathers up all of the shortcuts that have been
defined at various places & sticks them up on the menu, and makes
them work from the keyboard.

Note however that each shortcut key combo can only activiate one menu
item, so a certain amount of cooperative behavior is desirable for
plugin writers.  I think it would be a cool and possibly feasable
(but pretty hard)
project to allow users to set up shortcuts the way they want them.
