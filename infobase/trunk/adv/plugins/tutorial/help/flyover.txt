title: Flyover help

Help is the easiest.  In the third position of qmenu.item, we can
put a string which is displayed at the bottom-left of the screen when
the cursor sits on the menu item.  Or if the text is too long to be
likely to fit into the window down there, begin it with a `|', then
there's a message to press <F1> for help in the little window, and the
string will appear in a popup window in the middle of the screen when
<F1> is pressed.

So we might replace our current menu-adding commands with something
like this:
<code>
quarkpy.mapcommands.items.append(quarkpy.qmenu.item("&Tag Side", tagSideClick, "|`Tags' the selected side so that another side can be snapped to it by a later `Glue to Tagged' command.\n\nJust the thing for making sure the legs of the table are actually touching the ground."))
quarkpy.mapcommands.items.append(quarkpy.qmenu.item("&Glue to Tagged", glueSideClick, "Snap selected to tagged side"))
</code>
Note that these strings get rather long in the text-editor (and
the browser!!), but they
wrap around nicely in the display window.
