title: Putting a Command on a Menu
desc: starting import action menu register
 
<P>A plugin needs to do four things:
<OL Type=1>
<LI> Get noticed by Quark
<LI> Import resources from the rest of the program
<LI> Define the actions that the plugin will perform
<LI> Provide menu commands, buttons or some other facility for
     the user to initiate the actions
</OL>
And it should also register itself. So we'll do these five
things in turn.<P>
