title: Putting a Command on a Menu
desc: starting import action menu register

A plugin needs to do four things:

<html><OL>
<html><LI>
Get noticed by QuArK
<html><LI>
Import resources from the rest of the program
<html><LI>
Define the actions that the plugin will perform
<html><LI>
Provide menu commands, buttons or some other facility for the user to initiate the actions
<html></OL>

And it should also register itself. So we'll do these five
things in turn.
