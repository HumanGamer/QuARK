title: Getting Noticed
author: tiglari

To get noticed by the mapeditor, the name of a plugin
must start with `map' (the code that handles this is
<html><tt>loadmapeditor()</tt> in
<html><tt>quarkpy\qutils.py</tt>).
So we can shift the regular version of maptagside out of
the way by renaming it to say `tagside.py', and then
start a new file `maptagside.py' with our favorite
text editor.
