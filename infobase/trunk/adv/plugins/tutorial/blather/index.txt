title: Intro Blather

I'm not sure what the prerequisites for this tutorial really are in
terms of previous programming experience; some experience with
`Object Oriented Programming' will help, on the other
hand, messing with Python is a good way to acquire such experience
(definitely a kinder and gentler start than C++).  So why not give
it a go!  If you're a reasonably experienced programmer, you
can probably learn enough python by concurrently browing the
Python tutorial that comes with the Python distribution,
but if you're a newbie, you'll probably want to study
a book about Python first (suggestions in
<ref>adv/python/learning</ref>).

This tutorial is
not to teach programming, but rather to make up for inexperience
and general lack of talent at figuring out how OOP program work;
it's based on my first asking Armin lots of questions about how to do things
and writing up the answers, and later on seeing how he revised things
I had written.  It would be fair to say that the Three Commandments
are Ask, Imitate and Experiment.

In addition, since QuArK is after all a program for manipulating 3D
geometry, some kind of grasp of 3D math concepts such as normal vectors
and dot products is likely to help, tho there are certainly things
you can do without knowing anything about that kind of stuff.
I might try writing up a quickly intro to Object-Oriented
Programming and QuArK-relevant 3D-math, if I got some indication
that this would be helpful.

If you've done a bit of programming & want to dive right in, without
reading anything at all about Python first, it might be useful to know that
Python uses `whitespace formatting' for grouping, rather than
brackets:  all the statements in a block after an if-statement
should be indented further back than the if-statement, and by the
same amount.  It might also be helpful to know that Python objects
and data structures are much looser than those of of C/C++, so you
can add new fields to anything whenever you want to, without having
to mess around with declarations.

And of course you will need to consult
<ref>src/quarkx</ref>, the guide to the facilities that Delphi provides for Python.
This is certainly not an introduction, but does present all the basic
facilities that QuArK provides to the Python code, and as you get
more experience  writing plugins, you will be able to figure out more
just by browsing it.  Don't worry if it seems like a completely
impenetrable thicket at first!
And if you get stuck or think you've found a mistake
(it's been done before :)), don't hesitate
