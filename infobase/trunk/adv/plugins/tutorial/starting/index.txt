title: Starting Up

Since we'll be building a simplified version
of the `maptagside' plugin, which does side
tagging and gluing, and more,the first thing to do is to
disable the regular version of the plugin.  The simplest
way to do this is to rename it to `tagside'; this will
prevent it from loading when Quark starts, and you will
be able to see the effects of your own construction
emerge as you build it.

Then create your own file maptagside.py, & we're ready
to go.  Important point: the plugin's name must begin with
`map' in order to be loaded by the map editor.
