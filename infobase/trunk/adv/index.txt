This section discusses the features of QuArK that can be customized without modifying the source code.
This mainly includes:

<strong>Add-Ons</strong>:
lists describing new entity types, new textures, etc. This is what you need to have QuArK support
new Mods of the game or new games altogether.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Use of the <ref> adv/conversion \ QuArK Conversion Tools </ref> (see its section below) can help to create the
needed addon .qrk files without having to copy files and write code.

<strong>Python</strong>:
The language which much of the map-editor is written, and the
major components of the Python portion of the editor,
<ref> adv/quarkpy \ quarkpy </ref> and <ref> adv/plugins \ plugins </ref>.

See the section <ref> maped </ref> for more information about how to use the map editor.
