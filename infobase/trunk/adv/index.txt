This section discusses the features of QuArK that can be customized without modifying the source code.
This mainly includes:

<table>
<tr><td valign=top><strong>Add-Ons</strong>:
<td>lists describing new entity types, new textures, etc. This is what you need to have QuArK support new Mods of the game or new games altogether.<br>Use of the <ref> adv/conversion \ QuArK Conversion Tools </ref> (see its section below) can help to create the needed addon .qrk files without having to copy files and write code.
<tr><td valign=top>&nbsp;<td>&nbsp;
<tr><td valign=top><strong>Python</strong>:
<td>The language which much of the map-editor is written, and the major components of the Python portion of the editor, <ref> adv/quarkpy \ quarkpy </ref> and <ref> adv/plugins \ plugins </ref>.
</table>

See the section <ref> maped </ref> for more information about how to use the map editor.
