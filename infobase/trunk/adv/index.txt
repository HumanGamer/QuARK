<p>This section discusses the features of QuArK that can be customized without modifying the source code. This mainly includes:
</p>

<p><strong>Add-Ons</strong>: lists describing new entity types, new textures, etc. This is what you need to have QuArK support
new Mods of the game or new games altogether.
</p>

<p><strong>Plug-Ins</strong>: scripts programmed in Python that modify existing features or add new features to QuArK. They are
mainly related to the map editor, which is itself programmed mostly in Python.
</p>

<p>See section
<ref> maped
 for more information about how to use the map editor.
