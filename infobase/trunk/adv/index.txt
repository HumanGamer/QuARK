<p>This section discusses the features of QuArK that can be customized without modifying the source code. This mainly includes:
</p>

<p><strong>Add-Ons</strong>: lists describing new entity types, new textures, etc. This is what you need to have QuArK support
new Mods of the game or new games altogether.
</p>

<p><strong>Quarkpy</strong>: The basic map-editing facilities
provided by Python.

<p><strong>Plug-Ins</strong>: More Python providing a wide range of
specific facilities and enhancements.

 for more information about how to use the map editor.
