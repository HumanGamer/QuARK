title: Information Base Syntax
author: Armin Rigo

All ".txt" files in the infobase are formatted as follow : first, a list of keyword-value pairs, ended with a blank line, and
followed by the text itself. For example:

<code>
title: This is the title of what this file contains.
author: Your Name
subdir: list subdirectories
subdir: can be done on several lines
desc: list files
desc: without ".txt" extension

The text follows the blank line.
</code>

The most common keywords are given in this example. Notice that "subdir" and "desc" only make sense in the file "index.txt",
while "author" is only used in the opposite case. Other keywords might be parsed in the future. Also note that all file names
should be lowercase.

The text itself is formatted paragraph-by-paragraph, with at least one blank line between paragraphs (a single end-of-line is
not considered as separating two paragraphs). Paragraphs starting with <p> are assumed to be HTML, so can contain usual HTML
formatting commands. Other paragraphs are assumed to be pure text, and all special characters are translated, so that if you
type <strong> in a text paragraph, the browser will really display the text <strong>!

A special command is <ref>: if a line starts with these 5 characters, the remaining of the line is supposed to be a path to
another file of the InfoBase directory, relative to the root. It will be replaced by an HTML link to that file. Note that it
may be inside a paragraph as far as it's on its own line, so that you can type for example:

<code>
See
&lt;ref&gt; adv/doc/infobase-format
for more information.
</code>

The example will produce this line:

See
<ref> adv/doc/infobase-format
for more information.

If you want something other than the section title to appear in the
text, separate it from the file-name with '\':
<code>
See
&lt;ref&gt; adv/doc/infobase-format \ format stuff
for more information.
</code>

Further special commands are <pic>, <rsc> and <zip>.  If a line starts
with <pic>, the rest of the line in interpreted as the name of a graphic.
If it starts with <rsc>, the rest of it is just put into quotes, so that
it can for example be the source-value of an <img> element specifying
height, width, etc.

<P>If a line starts with <tt><zip></tt>, then the following material is taken as
the name of an `archive'.  Archives are treated in a special way due to
the disinclination of web-hosting to allow direct downloading of .zip
files from ordinary web-pages. Archives are expected to appear in the
subfolder <tt>zips</tt>.  How they are processed depends on whether
<TT>BUILD.PY</TT> is launched with the command-line argument
<tt>-local</tt> or not.  If it is, then the archive file is copied
into the a subfolder <tt>zips</tt> in <tt>output</tt>, and a suitable
link generated.  If it isn't (the default), then no copying happens,
and the link is prefixed by the value of the string <tt>ZIPLOC</tt>
specified at the top of <tt>format.txt</tt>.  The archives are then
to be uploaded to the appropriate server independently of the operations
of this script (but they should all be sitting in the <tt>zips</tt>
folder).</P>

A line may also begin with <text> or <html>, which force the current line to be interpreted as text or html, respectively,
regardless of the current paragraph mode.

The keyword
<html><tt>format: html</tt>
 will force the whole text to be interpreted as HTML. It will be dumped to the output .html file as
is. In this mode the only processed command are the `line starters' <ref>,
<zip>, etc.
