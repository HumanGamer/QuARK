title: The Information Base
author: Armin Rigo

The Information Base is the source of information that you're just reading. It is written as a set of organized text files
whose format is described below. The tool that translates these files and directories into a set of HTML files is the Python
script
<html><tt>BUILD.PY</tt>.

The directories correspond to the classification in the final HTML files. Each directory must contain a file
<html><tt>index.txt</tt>
 which gives the overall description of the category; it can also contain any number of other
<html><tt>.TXT</tt>
 files, which will be grouped into a single HTML. Each such text file correspond to a "question/answer" or item of discussion.
