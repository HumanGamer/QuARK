title: Python
desc: learning notes gotchas

Python is a very flexible, interpreted language that much of
QuArK is written in.  QuArK (versions 6.4 and higher) includes
a Python compiler, so all you have to do to change to the python
code is edit a *.py file in a text editor, save it, and run QuArK:
compilation of changed .py files into .pyc files is automatic.

If you want to develop in Python however, you will probably
want the full distribution from
<a href="http://www.python.org">www.python.org</a>, since this includes documentation including
a tutorial, command-line listener for testing out what functions do, etc.
