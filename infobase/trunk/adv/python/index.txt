<P>
Python is a very flexible, interpreted language that much of
Quark is written in.  The `minipy' that you had to download and
compile to run Quark at all includes a Python compiler, so
all you have to do to change to the python code is edit
a *.py file in a text editor, save it, and run Quark:
compilation of changed .py files into .pyc files is automatic.<P>

If you want to develop in Python however, you will probably
want the full distribution from <a href=http://www.python.org>
www.python.org</a>, since this includes documentation including
a tutorial,
command-line listener for testing out what functions do,
etc.
