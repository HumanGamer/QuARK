Most entities (Monster, Weapon, Door) have a set of parameters to set, so they
act in a certain way. These parameters are called <i>specifics</i> in QuArK.
Each specific can have an argument (arg) attached to it.

If you do not know what permitted values an arg can have, keep your
mouse-cursor steady and a blue 'flyover' help-box will appear, if there is any
help to that specific/arg pair.

Sometimes there may be an dropdown-listbox which contain valid args, or most
used args. Some specifics are only possible to turn on/off, these looks like
checkboxes. There might even be pushbuttons which opens another window, with
more specific/arg settings.

The above icons from left to right:

<table border=1 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=2>
<tr>
  <td valign=top align=center>
    <i>SF emhd</i>
  </td>
  <td>
    Short for 'SpawnFlags, selected Easy Medium Hard Deathmatch'. Click on this
    icon to change this entity's spawnflag parameters.
  </td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td valign=top align=center>
    <i><b>+</b></i>
  </td>
  <td>
    Icon to add a new specific/arg pair to this entity. You must rename the
    specific's name, to something that the selected entity can understand in
    the FPS-game.
  </td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td valign=top align=center>
    <i><b>-</b></i>
  </td>
  <td>
    Icon to remove the selected specific/arg pair from this entity. Some
    specifics you can't remove, and others will, by pressing the - icon, clear
    the arg of the specific.
  </td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td valign=top align=center>
    <i>HelpBook</i>
  </td>
  <td>
    Keep your mouse-cursor steady on this icon to get a blue 'flyover'
    help-box, which will contain specific description/help for the selected
    entity, and not just a single specific/arg pair. Press the icon to start
    your web-browser, and it will take you to a page which contain more
    information about this entity, if there is such a page.
  </td>
</tr>
</table>
