QuArK was originally envisaged as having a map editor and
a model editor.  The latter hasn't been finished, but Andy
Vincent is working hard on it.

Files that are providing facilities for both editors are
usually prefixed with q- (qdictionnary.py, qkeys.py, etc.),
those for the map editor with map- (mapeditor.py, mapentities.py),
and those for the mdel editor with mdl-.  These are however
just conventions, and not always adhered to.
