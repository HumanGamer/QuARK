The brush-arch is a collection of brushes designed to fill
in a boxy hole to make it look like an archway.  So a
good way to start would be to make a wall with a hole in it,
perhaps by first making a wall-brush, then a subtractor
brush, then subtracting.  The result might look like this,
where the bottom of the subtractor has then been raised
up a bit in preparation for the next step:

Now to make the arch-shaped filler, facing the brush that's been
left in the archway, <act>RMB|Brush Curves|Arch</act>:

Some additional brushes forming arch-shape (tinted blue
in some views, such as the one to the right) will appear
inside the brush, and if the brush itself
isn't selected, it will be invisible.

What's happened is that the original brush has been put
inside a duplicator (you should check this  by fossicking
around in the <ref> intro/mapeditor/dataforms/treeview \ tree-view </ref>),
which makes it invisible unless selected.
By default, four brushes are produced, and there is a gap
in the middle, but this and various other aspects of what
is produced can be changed by changing the
<ref> intro/mapeditor/dataforms/specsargsview \ specifics </ref> of the
duplicator.

Now the most important aspect of this way of making an
arch is that it can be changed dynamically, after it's
made.  To see this, click inside its area until the arch
itself disappears, and its `guide brush' appears instead
because it's selected:

We can now drag this brush around, and the arch will move,
and more importantly,  we can reproportion the arch by
dragging the individual faces.  Especially, we can change
it's shape inside the hole by dragging the bottom up
and down:

Since these are ordinary faces, which provide data to the duplicator
code the makes the arch patches, we can do all the ordinary face
stuff to them, such as tag/glue.

</td></tr>

So there's the shape; the next problem is to control
the textures.
