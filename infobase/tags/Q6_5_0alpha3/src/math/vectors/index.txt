title: Vectors 
desc: intro coords cross


Here is a rather short introduction to vectors, in certain
respects rather philosophical, but also with reference
to QuArK's vector facilities.  The first few chapters of
books on 'vector calculus' are a good source for this
kind of material, although fortunately there's little need
to wade very far into them (I learned a lot from
Marsen & Tromba (1976) <U>Vector Calculus</U>, Freeman
and Co., the material here being covered in Chapter 1).
