title: Changes from q5.10
author: tiglari

New commands are:

<UL>
<LI>Everything on the Linking submenu and relevant options
<LI>Cut poly along tagged
<LI>Merge Polys
<LI>Project texture from tagged.
</UL>

And there is one significant change in behavior:  previously,
the texture wrap operations copied all of the content and
surface features as well as the texture name and alignment info;
now they only do the latter.  I regard the earlier behavior
as a bug rather than a feature, but if you disagree, we can
work something out.
