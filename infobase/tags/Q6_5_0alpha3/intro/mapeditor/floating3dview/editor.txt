In the 3D window, you will be able to move around in the level, almost as if
you were doing it using <g>NOCLIP</g> in the FPS-game.

To move around, you can use the mouse, or keys, when the mouse is inside the
3D-window so the window becomes active. The keys you can find and redefine in
the <ref> intro/configuration/general/3dview</ref> options.

Another feature of the 3D window is, that you can edit your map in it. You can
click on a polyhedron, and it will appear selected with wireframes. You can
move the selection around, just as you would do it on the map-views. Even align
textures on faces can be done in the 3D window.
