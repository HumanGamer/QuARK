title: Helping in QuArK's development (adding games, features...)
author: Armin Rigo / Decker

If you want to help with QuArK's development, here is how you can do various things. You don't have to be a programmer to
give some help! If you need help about these ways of helping, see the
<html><a href="http://www.planetquake.com/quark/forums.shtml">"quark-python" forum</a> on the web site.

<html><li><strong>Support for a mod</strong>:<br>
          If you want to write support for a game mod (e.g. a Mission Pack or any smaller mod), you have to write a small
          add-on file which lists the new entities available and their attributes, as well as the new textures, if any. This
          process is relatively easy. Try opening with any text editor one of the add-on files included in the QuArK
          distribution, e.g. "CTFq2.qrk" (Capture-The-Flag for Quake 2.) This is the kind of file you have to write. This is
          described in detail in
          <ref>adv
          .

<html><li><strong>Fixes and enhancements in the existing game data</strong>:<br>
          If you want to enhance the existing game-specific data (e.g. the entity lists, the available entity settings, and
          on-line help for all this), you can do so by editing the files "DataXXX.qrk" -- "DataQ1.qrk" for Quake 1,
          "DataQ2.qrk" for Quake 2, etc. The format of these files is the same as for the add-ons for the support of a mod,
          with a single difference: For performance, these large files are not directly editable with a text editor; instead,
          they are stored in a binary format. You can get the original full-text files from
          <ref>src/sf
          in the directory
<html><a href="http://cvs.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/cvsweb.cgi/runtime/addons/?cvsroot=quark">runtime/addons</a>.

<html><li><strong>A Python plug-in</strong>:<br>
          A large part of the map editor is written in a scripting language called Python. This code is distributed with QuArK
          -- you already have it in the
<html><tt>.PY</tt> files of the directories "quarkpy" and "plugins". If you want to
          program an enhancement to the map editor, you can probably do it in Python, just by modifying these files or adding a
          new file in "plugins". No other tool is needed. For documentation, you can refer to the
<html><a href="http://www.python.org">Python home page</a> and
          <ref>adv
          .

<html><li><strong>Direct changes in the source code</strong>:<br>
          The source code of QuArK is freely available. The main programming language is Borland Delphi (any version from 2 to
          4 will do). You can get it as explained in
          <ref>src
          , under the conditions of the GNU General Public Licence found in the file "copying.txt" in the source
          archive. Be aware, however, that the map editor itself is almost completely written in Python and not in Delphi, so
          first check if what you want to do can be done in Python.
