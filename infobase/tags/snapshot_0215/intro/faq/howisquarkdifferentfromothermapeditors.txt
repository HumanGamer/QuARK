title: How is QuArK different from other map editors?
author: Gryphon

One of the primary differences QuArK has from other editors is that it allows users to edit more than one aspect of games like
Quake, Quake 2, Hexen II, etc. Versatile, it allows you to use one tool to edit textures, manipulate models, organize .PAK
files and create maps, among many other things.

In the past, another interesting difference was that QuArK had a distinctive 2-view format in regards to looking at your map.
It still retains this as a default, but now, allows you to choose other formats that might be better suited for your needs.
