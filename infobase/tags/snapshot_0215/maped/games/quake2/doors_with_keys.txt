How do I use keys and doors in Quake-2?

<html><b>Answer:</b><br>
<html>The keys are the "key_<i>xxx</i>&nbsp;" entities.
Countrary to the good old Quake-1,
you cannot simply tell a door it must not open unless the player carries
some key.

The entity that knows whether the player carries a key or not
is "trigger_key". This entity is a 'relay trigger', which means that it
must be fired by something else, and it will then fire its own targets
if the triggering player carries the correct key.

You can use it between a button and a door, for example. When the button is pressed, it doesn't
directly fire the door, but the trigger_key, which in turn fires the door
if the player has the correct key.

If you don't want a button, you can
replace it with a trigger_multiple just in front of the door, so that the
door opens when the player approaches.
