<dt><a name="capturetheflag"></a>Capture The Flag<dd>[CTF] A team based modification widely played in <a href="#quake1">Quake-1</a> and later games. Two teams have each their own flag, which they must protect from the other team, but at the same time try to steal the other team's flag, and carry it home to score. Many later modifications have been based upon the same Capture The Flag concept, but 'Threewave Capture the Flag' was the first.
