This section discusses the features of QuArK that can be customized without modifying the source code.
This mainly includes:

<html><strong>Add-Ons</strong>:
lists describing new entity types, new textures, etc. This is what you need to have QuArK support
new Mods of the game or new games altogether.

<html><strong>Python</strong>:
The language which much of the map-editor is written, and the
major components of the Python portion of the editor,
<ref>adv/quarkpy \ quarkpy
 and
<ref>adv/plugins \ plugins
.


See the section
