title: Plug-Ins
subdir: tutorial

Plug-Ins are scripts programmed in Python that modify
existing features or add new features to QuArK. They
are mainly related to the map editor, which is itself
programmed mostly in Python.

Probably the best way to get a feel for plugins is to
first work thru a tutorial, then look at some existing
examples.  There's an archive
<ZIP>plugin_examples.zip
of working examples from the tutorial.
