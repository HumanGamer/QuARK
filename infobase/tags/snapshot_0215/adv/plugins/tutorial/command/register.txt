Finally, a properly dressed plugin should announce itself
to Quark, so it will be listed under Options|List of Plugins.
This is done by including an Info statement, normally at
the beginning of the file:
<code>
Info = {
   "plug-in":       "Side Tag & Glue",
   "desc":          "Basic Side tagging and gluing to tagged side",
   "date":          "1999",
   "author":        "tiglari",
   "author e-mail": "tiglari@hexenworld.net",
   "quark":         "Version 6" }
</code>

So now we've got a proper plugin; next is to get it to
do something useful.
