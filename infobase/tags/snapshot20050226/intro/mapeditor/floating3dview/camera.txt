Once you have created a new 3D-window, a 'eye'-icon will appear in your
map-views, showing where the camera are positioned in the level, and in what
direction its pointing.

You can move this camera around, and adjust its direction-handle, just like any
other entity. However the camera won't be a visible object in the
<ref>../dataforms/treeview </ref>, since it only exist when a 3D-window are
open.

If you have more than one 3D-window opened, there will also be more 'eye'-icons
in your map-views. One per 3D-window.
