This panel shows additional information about the texture.

<i>Link to</i> indicates which texture you are linking to, and "in directory"
is the directory which contains this file.  If you have copied the texture into
the add-on instead of linking to it then "Link to" and "in directory" will not
appear.

<i>Path</i> is the directory containing the texture.

<i>Contents</i>, <i>Flags</i> and <i>Value</i> are derived from the
<ref>./textureflags</ref> settings, and the
<img border=0 align=absmiddle>textureflagsbutton.png</img> button displays the
<ref>./textureflags</ref> window.

<i>Next texture in anim. sequence</i> allows you to string together a series of
textures to make an animated texture.  Each texture points to the next one to
be shown, and the last one should point back to the first texture in the
sequence.
