title: Using the bot waypointer add-on
author: Fredrick

After you have activated the add-on, as shown above, you have a new function in the QuArK tool menu. First open the map or .BSP-file you want
to edit, then push the new button that have arrived at the left side (default layout) then open the waypoint that have the same
name as the map and that ends with <tt>*.wpt</tt>

If you want to make a completly new waypoint, you have to import another waypoint file, and then delete all of them, except one
last waypoint (this will change in later versions.)

You can now use the copy/paste functions to add new waypoints. If you see
the <tt>target1</tt> flag at the top of a waypoint, this is where you can target the waypoint to another waypoint, making more ways for
a bot to go. Use the usual + and - icons to add and delete spec/arg-pairs.

Here you can se an overview of the waypoints in the map.

Here you can see the node in the middle with 6 links, which means that a bot can go 6 different ways from that waypoint. If you
select one waypoint, you can also see different flag settings, weither this is a camping-, sniper-waypoint etc.
