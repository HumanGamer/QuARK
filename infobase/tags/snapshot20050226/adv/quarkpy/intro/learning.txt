title: Learning Python

There are introductions to Python available at various
levels:
<UL>
<LI>The tutorial etc. that comes with Python: Quite
 usable if you're a reasonably experienced (intermediate?)
 programmer.
<LI> <strong>Programming Python</strong> (OReilly): All the info is
there, but the presentation is not for beginners.
<LI> <strong>Learning Python</strong> (OReilly): Looks like a good
 introduction for newbie programmers.
<LI> <strong> Learn Python in 24 Hours </strong> (SAMS): This one looks like
 it could be used by absolute newbie programmers, since it
 seems to introduce basic programming concepts from scratch.
 HINT HINT: if some reader of this is an absolute newbie
 programmer, their reactions to this book would be useful
 information.
</UL>
