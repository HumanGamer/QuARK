Saving your work is also a good idea. There are several ways to do this.

When you first start a new map, you should save it, using the <tt>Save in QuArK
Explorer</tt>. This will create a new entry in your QuArK project
(<g>.QRK</g>), so you can keep multiple versions of the same map, in one
project file.

You can also choose to save it as a QuArK map-file (<g>.QKM</g>), but then its
only one map per file.

The last option, is to save it as a <g>.MAP</g> file. However this is not
advisable when using QuArK, because you loose all the neat information that is
stored in the tree-view, like; groups, duplicators, negative brushes, shared
faces, etc. Only save as a .MAP file, if you want others to look at your work,
and they use another map-editor than QuArK.

Try using the <tt>Save in QuArK Explorer</tt> a few times. Notice that you will
be brought back to the QuArK explorer when using this, so you can see that a
new entry is added to your project. You can rename the entries by slowly
double-clicking on them, or press the F2 key (Just like in Windows'
File-Explorer.)

Also when saving to the QuArK explorer, you then have to save your project
there.
