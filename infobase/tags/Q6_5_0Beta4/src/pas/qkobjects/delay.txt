title: Delay loading
author: Tiglari / Armin

If FFlags contains the bit <tt>ofNotLoadedToMemory</tt> then FNode points to
data that give the file and the position of the object inside the file. This is
for the delay-loading mechanism. With this mechanism, when an object is loaded,
the <tt>FSpecifics</tt> and <tt>FSubElements</tt> fields are filled, but the
children in <tt>FSubElements</tt> are "empty" : they are QObject which still
sit on the disk. Their FNode fields give the position for later reading. The
method <tt>Acces</tt> must be called on them when they need to be actually
loaded. You must never try to read <tt>FSpecifics</tt> or <tt>FSubElements</tt>
before the object is actually loaded; if you're unsure call <tt>Acces</tt>
first.

In the map editor this is often not necessary because the complete subtree of
"worldspawn" is always loaded when the map editor opens.
