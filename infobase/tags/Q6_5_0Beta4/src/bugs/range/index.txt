title: Range Check Errors
desc: map other

By enabling Range checking in Delphi (Delphi 6/7: Project > Options... >
Compiler > Range checking), the compiler will build in checks into the
program to make sure the boundaries of arrays are not crossed, and that
non-allocated memory is not referenced.

Don't forget to (re)BUILD the project after toggling this options. If you
forget this (and do a normal COMPILE), only the newly changed files will
have the altered option applied.
