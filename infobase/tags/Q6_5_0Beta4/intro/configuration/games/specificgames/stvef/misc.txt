<b>Installing the q3map_2.5.16_win32_x86 build tool</b>

When you install this program you will need to direct it to the
<a href="intro.configuration.games.specificgames.stvef.html#config">QuArK files</a> folder as shown
earlier in the <a href="intro.configuration.games.specificgames.stvef.html#config">Configuration section</a>.
That is really all you need to verify.

<b>Changing and re-running a map</b>

Normally, I run STVEF in a separate window (800 x 600), instead of its "Full Screen" mode when working on
a map, for a couple of reasons.<br>
First it's a lot easer to see around to view something in the
editor that you might be concentrating on with your work.<br>
The other is being able to jump back
and forth between the editor and the game running by simply pressing the <b>~</b> Tilley key.
This will release you from the game and back into QuArK or any other program you want to use.
Then just click on the game window to go back into it and the Tilley key again to cancel the console.
It seems less confusing that way.

Unfortunately it does not have the ability to make changes in your map while the game is still running
and then rebuild and reload the map.<br>
To do this you will need to close the game and go through the normal process once again.<br>
But basically all you need to do is just click the QuArK menu item and off you go.

To close the game, press the Esc key and select "Exit Program" > "Yes" from its menu and
press Esc again to stop the games "Log Off" recording from playing.

<b>Other Comments</b>

Some entities and\or models do not work properly or at all. These are erroneous items that were not
done correctly by other parties and is not a bug with QuArK. However, other entities may not have
been fully understood as to their proper needs and settings which could be an item to bring to our
attention for correction.
