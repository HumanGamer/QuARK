<i>Empty Component </i>&nbsp;: This will create a new <g>Clean</g> Model component.
To use this function you must select at least one face of another component and have the
<a href="intro.modeleditor.toolpalettes.display.html">Linear Drag Handles</a> button active (clicked on).
All Frames will be there but without any vertexes or triangle faces. Also the <g>Skins</g> and <g>Skeleton</g>
sub-items will be empty as well for a fresh start. Skins or faces can then be moved or copied there from other
components but do NOT change its name until you have at least one face (triangle) created or it will not appear
on the <g>move\copy to</g> menus. Skin textures can also be selected from the
<a href="intro.texturebrowser.overview.html#overview">Texture Browser</a> if you have those setup.

<i>New Component </i>&nbsp;: This will create a new model component of currently selected Model Mesh faces only,
including its Skins, Frames and Skeleton sub-items. The selected faces will also be removed from their current
components group. Once created you can change the temporary name <g>new component</g> to something else by
clicking on it.

<i>Move Faces To </i>&nbsp;: This will move currently selected Model Mesh faces from one component to another
(if NOT <a href="intro.modeleditor.rmbmenus.html#treeviewrmbmenus">Hidden</a>) by means of a menu
(shown to the right here) that will appear listing all available components to choose from.
If none others exist it will instruct you to create a <g>New Component</g> first, using the
function above this one on the RMB menu.

<i>Copy Faces To </i>&nbsp;: This will copy currently selected Model Mesh faces from one component to another
(if NOT <a href="intro.modeleditor.rmbmenus.html#treeviewrmbmenus">Hidden</a>) by means of a menu
(shown to the right here) that will appear listing all available components to choose from.
If none others exist it will instruct you to create a <g>New Component</g> first, using the
function above this one in the RMB menu.

<i>Delete Faces </i>&nbsp;: This will delete currently selected Model Mesh faces from the currently
selected component and any unused vertexes, by other faces (triangles), of those faces.

<b><u>Special Notes:</u></b>

Any new triangle(s) that are created will still need to be <b>Skinned</b> on the
<a href="intro.modeleditor.model.html#mesh">Skin-view page</a> for proper viewing and completion of the
triangle(s). Any triangles that are moved or copied to another component may not need to be <b>Skinned</b>
if the new component is using the same skin as the component the triangles were moved or copied from.

All of these functions actions will be specifically identified on the
<a href="intro.modeleditor.menu.html#editmenu">Undo/Redo</a> dialog of the
<a href="intro.modeleditor.menu.html#editmenu">Edit menu</a> and can easily be reversed.

If all of the faces (triangles) are moved from one component to another, the original component
becomes a <g>dead</g> component and can be deleted.
