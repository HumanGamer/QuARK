Pressing this button, will open up the movement configuration box, so you can
specify different values for the move-, enlarge-, shift-, inflate/deflate- and
rotation-buttons.

<i>Move selection (x,y,z)</i>: Here you specify, the distance in units, the
<ref> ./move \ move-button </ref> should move the selection with. These values
can be both positive and negative. For instance; '+8 -16 0' will move the
selection +8 units in X-direction, -16 units in Y-direction and 0 units in
Z-direction, from the common center of the selection.

<i>Zoom factor</i>: This value specify by which factor to
<ref> ./enlargeshrink \ enlarge/shrink </ref> your selection. You can't specify
a value lower than '1', but you can specify floating point values like '1.75'.

<i>Shift Left/Right by</i>: By which amount in units, the
<ref> ./inflatedeflate \ shif-button </ref> should change your
selection. A negative value will shift (move) the selection to the left by the
number of units specified, and a positive will shift the selection to the right.

<i>Rotation angle</i>: The distance in degrees, the
<ref> ./rotate \ rotation-buttons </ref> should rotate your selection. Best
values are from 1 to 180, since specifying anything above 180 or negative you
could just use the other rotation-button.

<b>Linear Handle settings</b>: Special settings for this editor's Linear Handles.

<i>Linear Handle Setting</i>: larger value makes the editor's handle bigger & visa-versa, default is 4.

<i>Linear Rotation Speed</i>: larger value causes the editor's handle to have faster rotation & visa-versa,
default is .057

<i>Skin-view Linear Setting</i>: larger value makes the Skin-view's handle bigger & visa-versa, default is 4.
