With the  <a href="intro.mapeditor.toolpalettes.objectmodes.html">QuArK Quick Object Makers</a> an abundance of
3D object shapes can be created by simply choosing one of the toolbar object buttons and, while holding down the
<g>LMB</g>, dragging the cursor around within any 2D view. Any of these objects can easily be created with the
finished structure as an addition to the currently selected model component.
In the image below you can see just some of these shapes of which all of the finished objects will have triangular faces.

The top row shows a simple (minimum amount of faces) shape for the Sphere, Pyramid\Cone and Cylinder objects.<br>
The second rows shows these same objects as more complex objects (more faces used).<br>
The third row shows simple, complex and more complex objects of the Torus maker.
