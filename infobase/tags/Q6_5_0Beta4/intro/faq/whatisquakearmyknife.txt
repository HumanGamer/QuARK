title: What IS Quake Army Knife?
author: Gryphon, tiglari

Quake Army Knife (QuArK) is a multi-purpose tool for the games using engines
similar to or based on the Quake engine by id software. QuArK has the ability to
directly edit maps, and to a limited extent, models, and can import, export and convert
sounds, textures and various other game assets. It is also able to modify .pak
and .pk3  files, as well as importing compiled BSP's in order to study the
entities as well as add/change/delete entities from these files. No other game
editing tool available has the ability to do all of these things.

QuArK is completely different from the desktop publishing program
Quark.
