title: Making a simple bend with two pipes
author: Decker

First you create the two pipes, and place them where you want them:

Then you intersect the ends:

Next you use the cut tool, to cut at the exact middle of the two pipes:

Remove the pieces that are unwanted:

Now you got a pipe with a very simple (and unrealistic looking) bend:
