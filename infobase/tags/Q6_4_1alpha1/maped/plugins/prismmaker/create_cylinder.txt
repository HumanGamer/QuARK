title: How to create a cylinder/pipe
author: Decker

The fastest way to create a cylinder/pipe, is to use the '<b>Make Prism</b>' which is located in the '<b>Commands</b>' menu.

<b>Prism texture</b>, is pretty self explanatory.

<b>Start prism on a vertex</b>, well... experiment with it. I always keep it marked.

<b>Number of sides</b>, should also be pretty self explanatory, since its how 'round' you want the cylinder to be. The larger
the number, the more sides/faces there will be, and 'rounder' it will look.

<b>Radius of prism</b>, is half its diameter. To get a larger cylinder/pipe increase this value. I tend to keep it a value
which aligns to my current grid (32, 48, 64, 192, 256, etc.)

<b>Height of prism</b>, is how tall the cylinder should be. However I rarely change it, because its much easier to do it in
the map-views, when the cylinder have been created.

<b>Vertex on grid</b>, is if you want all edges to be aligned to the grid. If you create a very 'round' cylinder in a rough
grid 32, and this is marked, it will not look good. It is however better to keep edges on a grid-vertex.

<b>Size of grid</b>, if the above is checked, this is the 'local grid' the cylinder will be created in.

<b>Pie-slices</b>, mark this if you want to 'explode' the cylinder, or make a hollow one. More about that later.

<b>Share faces</b>, if the pie-slices is marked, you can choose to use the face-sharing ability of QuArK, on the top and
bottom faces of the cylinder.
