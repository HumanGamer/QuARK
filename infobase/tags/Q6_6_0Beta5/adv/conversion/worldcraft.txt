This tool only works with <g>.fgd</g> files that come with different versions of Worldcraft, another map editor.

Also, it will only work with one of these files at a time and it will not setup any of the entity’s <g>Specifics</g>,
optional items to set for an entity. Those would need to be done by hand. At this time, the
<a href="adv.conversion.html#conversiontool">Conversion Tool</a> above does not process these types of files.

When its menu item is selected, a file selection window will open that is used to navigate to the <g>.fgd</g>
file location and select it. This will start the conversion and give further instructions.

Another tool that exist in <g>QuArK</g> is the <a href="adv.addons.html#entitytool">Entity Extractor</a> which
will search through a game's <g>.bsp</g> files to get the entities.
