Allows Multiple Color Painting of the selected model's skin texture.

Like the <a href="intro.modeleditor.toolpalettes.paintmodes.html#solidcolor">Solid Color Paint</a>
this also works in conjunction with the
<a href="intro.modeleditor.toolpalettes.paintmodes.html#colorpicker">Color Picker</a> ,
described in more detail below, as one method of setting the color of the paint brush
and, with both active, it also effects the way different mouse buttons work.

One difference is the <g>LMB</g>, which normally, with a quick single click, will cause the
component the cursor is over in a view to be selected. Now it will select the color that the
cursor is over as the primary, top or start, color setting for the <g>Airbrush Paint</g> brush.

The other difference is the <g>MMB</g>, which normally, with a quick single click, will cause the
view that the cursor is in to do an automatic zoom. Now it will select the color that the
cursor is over as the second, lower or end, color setting for the <g>Airbrush Paint</g> brush.

It also works in conjunction with the
<a href="intro.modeleditor.toolpalettes.paintmodes.html#colorselector">Color Selector & Paint Settings</a>
which not only changes the color to paint with, but gives settings for the paint brush size, shape and
available <g>Airbrush effects</g> as well.
It does not effect the normal mouse button functions.

The ability to perform other editing functions will also remain in effect, such as dragging vertex handles,
selecting faces, zooming, panning, rotating and so on.
