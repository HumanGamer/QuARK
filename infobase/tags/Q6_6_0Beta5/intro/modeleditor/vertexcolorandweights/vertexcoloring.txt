<g>Vertex Coloring</g> uses actual colors to give a model different lighting effects.
These colors are applied directly to the models mesh vertexes as demonstrated in the first screen shot to the right.

When the proper graphics displaying is used those vertex colors are spread between each other, from vertex to vertex,
of the models mesh triangles to give a hew effect of the colors as shown in the second screen shot to the right.
Unfortunately, at this time, QuArK's Model Editor does not have that graphics displaying capabilities.

When the model is used in the proper game engine, this hewing will effect various lighting features of that
game engine and produce the desired results.

QuArK's Model Editor does however supports the color selection, changing, application and removal of the
Vertex Coloring system for those kinds of models and game engines.

The functions that handle Vertex Coloring are located on the
<a href="intro.modeleditor.dataforms.html#specsargsview">frame Specifics/ Args</a> page
and is accessible by selecting a single frame or the <g>Frames folder</g> of a model component and nothing else.

<g><i><b><u>UV Vertex Colors</u></b></i></g>&nbsp;:<br>
To the right we show a screen shot of that portion of the
<a href="intro.modeleditor.dataforms.html#specsargsview">frame Specifics/ Args</a> page that deals with Vertex Coloring.<br>
To be valid, all vertexes must have a color applied to them or the model will not be accepted by the game engine.

<u><i>vertex color </i></u>&nbsp;: This specific has two lines and methods to select the color you wish to use.<br>
The first line displays the actual three <g>RGB</g> values of the color. Each one ranges from 0 to 1.0 and can be hand entered.<br>
The second line displays the actual color on the <g>color selector button</g>. By clicking on that button a
<g>Color Selector window</g> will appear that you can visually pick a color from. This will also change
its <g>RGB</g> values in the line above.

<u><i>show vertex color </i></u>&nbsp;: When this is checked and if the model has Vertex Coloring,
those colors will be displayed, If not the default colors of a vertex will be drawn.

<u><i>apply color </i></u>&nbsp;: Once you have selected some vertexes by doing a <g>LMB</g> drag
click the gray <g>apply color</g> button to give the above chosen color to those vertexes.

<u><i>remove color </i></u>&nbsp;: Once you have selected some vertexes by doing a <g>LMB</g> drag
click the gray <g>remove color</g> button to remove all vertex coloring from those vertexes.
