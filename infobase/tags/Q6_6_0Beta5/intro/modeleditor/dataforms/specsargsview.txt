title: Specifics/Args-view

This page is used for a variety of different elements that have a set of
parameters to set, so they act in a certain way. These parameters are called
<i>specifics</i> in QuArK. Each specific can have an argument (arg) attached, or associated, with it.<br>
At this time primarily <a href="intro.modeleditor.editelements.html#bones">Bones</a>
and <a href="intro.modeleditor.importexport.html">Python Model Importers\Exporters</a> use it.

Selecting the <a href="intro.modeleditor.dataforms.html#treeview">Frames</a> folder,
a number of frames or a single frame only, will display the
<g>frame type page</g> for the specific type of model that is set, if such a page exist.

If a single bone is selected it will display the
<a href="intro.modeleditor.editelements.html#specificsettings">bone's page</a> for that particular bone.

Selecting a single component displays its page where you can set a <g>tint</g> color for each
component that will be applied over that component's texture and lines when a
<a href="intro.modeleditor.rmbmenus.html#viewsrmbmenus">view's RMB menu</a> item
<a href="intro.modeleditor.rmbmenus.html#viewsrmbmenus">Use Component Colors</a>
is active (checked) to help distinguish one component from another.

If you do not know what permitted values an arg can have, place your
mouse-cursor over that item for a second and a blue 'flyover' help-box will appear,
if there is any help for that specific/arg pair.

Sometimes there may be a dropdown-listbox which contain valid args, or most
used args. Some specifics are only possible to turn on/off, these looks like
checkboxes. There might even be pushbuttons which opens another window, with
more specific/arg settings.

The top bar of icons from left to right are:
<table border=1 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=2>
<tr>
  <td valign=top align=center>
    <i>Tree-view</i>
  </td>
  <td>
    Click on this icon to display the tree-view which is a
    hierarchy structure of all the elements currently loaded into the editor.
  </td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td valign=top align=center>
    <i>Specifics/ Args view</i>
  </td>
  <td>
    This is the page that you see to the right which varies depending on
    what you have selected in the tree-view or the editor's view.
  </td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td valign=top align=center>
    <i>Skin-view</i>
  </td>
  <td>
    Click on this icon to display the Skin-view which contains the current
    skin texture that is being used. This is the main view where many actions
    are performed that directly effect that texture image.
  </td>

The second bar of icons from left to right are:
<table border=1 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=2>
<tr>
  <td valign=top align=center>
    <i>SF<br>set model type</i>
  </td>
  <td>
    Click on this icon to display supported Python Import\Exporters model formats
    and select one you wish to use for exporting your model as and\or
    specifics of that type of model format, any of which can use this page.<br>
    See the section about <ref>intro/modeleditor/importexport</ref>
  </td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td valign=top align=center>
    <i>HelpBook</i>
  </td>
  <td>
    Keep your mouse-cursor steady on this icon to get a blue 'flyover'
    help-box, which will contain specific description/help for the selected
    item, and not just a single specific/arg pair. Press the icon to display
    this help in a window. Some elements that use this page may provide additional
    detail, pressing your <b>F1</b> key will take you to a page which contains more
    information about its use, if there is such a page.
  </td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td valign=top align=center>
    <i>Vertex Weights<br>Dialog button</i>
  </td>
  <td>
    Click on this icon to open and display this dialog which contains
    settings and data dealing with vertex weights. Not all model formats
    will cause this button to be available for use.<br>
    See the section about <ref>intro/modeleditor/vertexcolorandweights</ref>

<u><i>classname </i></u>&nbsp;: This shows the name of the selected item causing this page to be displayed.
Usually this item's name can be changed to any name you choose
in the <a href="intro.modeleditor.dataforms.html#treeview">tree-view</a> by pressing your <b>F2</b> key.
Once <b>Enter</b> is pressed to change the name, it will update the
<a href="intro.modeleditor.dataforms.html#specsargsview">Specifics/Args</a> page.

<u><i>current skin </i></u>&nbsp;: This is a read only item displaying the path and name of the current skin texture.

<u><i>edit skin </i></u>&nbsp;: By clicking the gray 'edit skin' button, it will open the above texture image in the external
editor that is set to use in
<a href="intro.configuration.general.html#externaleditors">QuArK's Configuration External editors</a> section.

<i><b><u>UV Vertex Colors</u></b></i>&nbsp;: This section is used
for color selection, displaying, applying and removing <b>UV</b> vertex coloring.<br>
Not all model formats use this method. See the section about <ref>intro/modeleditor/vertexcolorandweights</ref>

<i><b><u>Vertex Weight Colors</u></b></i>&nbsp;: This section is used in conjunction with the
<a href="intro.modeleditor.editelements.html#specificsettings">Bone's Specifics page</a>
for Vertex Weights. See that page for their descriptions.<br>
Not all model formats use this method. See the section about <ref>intro/modeleditor/vertexcolorandweights</ref>

<i><b><u>Shader File</u></b></i>&nbsp;: This section is for those model format types that use texture shaders
to give different appearances and effects to a model.

<u><i>shader file </i></u>&nbsp;: This gives the full path and file name that contains the texture shader being used.

<u><i>shader name </i></u>&nbsp;: This gives the name of the shader being used that is contained in the above file.

<u><i>shader keyword </i></u>&nbsp;: This displays a keyword, if the current texture has one, to identify it in the above shader.

<u><i>shader lines </i></u>&nbsp;: This is an adjustable setting for the 'mesh shader' window below to make it larger or smaller
by using the arrow buttons to the far right, or an amount entered by hand.

<u><i>edit shader </i></u>&nbsp;: By clicking the gray 'edit shader' button, it will open the above shader code in the external
editor that is set to use in
<a href="intro.configuration.general.html#externaleditors">QuArK's Configuration External editors</a> section.<br>
This allows that shader code to be hand edited and saved for customized use. Its proper application and placement must be done by the user.

<u><i>mesh shader </i></u>&nbsp;: This is a window that displays the shader code and can be adjusted in size by using the above
'shader lines' entry field.
