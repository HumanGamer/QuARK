Basically there are two ways to import a skin texture:<br>
1) Through the Texture Browser by
<a href="intro.texturebrowser.tutorials.html#textureimports">making a copy of</a> or
<a href="intro.texturebrowser.tutorials.html#texturelinks">link to</a> the skin image file and

2) By using a component's Skins Specifics / Arg page (detailed steps below).

By selecting a component's Skins folder, or a skin within that folder, you will activate the Specifics page for it.<br>
<a href="intro.modeleditor.overview.html#overview">You can then click on the icon button above the tree-view</a>
to show that page or hold your <g>LMB</g> down while over the icon and drag the page out to display it in its own window.

One that Specifics page click on the icon button that shows three dots on it next to where it
says either <g>import skin</g> or <g>skin name</g>, depending on if you selected the
Skins folder or a skin in the tree-view.

Clicking that button will bring up a File Selection window that you can use to locate and
select the skin texture image file you wish to import. Selecting the file will cause it to be imported.

This method supports most of the texture file formats that are available in QuArK.
However, some, such as .pcx, files use a color pallet for their images and need to
be imported through one of the
<a href="intro.texturebrowser.tutorials.html">Texture Browser methods</a>
above to get processed properly.
