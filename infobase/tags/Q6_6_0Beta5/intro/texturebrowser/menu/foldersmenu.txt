<i>New main folder...</i> Lets you create a new top level folder.  You
would then typically create texture lists under this folder, or create
subfolders which would then contain texture lists.  This folder can be stored
in the opened <g>.QRK</g> file (and the textures will only be available for
maps also stored in this .QRK file), in a registered add-on (a list of add-ons
is presented so you can select one), or in a new add-on.  Storing the folder in
a new add-on is generally recommended, then the textures will always be
available, and you can easily send the add-on to other QuArK users.

<i>New sub-folder</i> Permits the creation of a sub-folder to contain
groups of related textures and <ref> ./newtexturelist </ref>
folders.  You need to select an existing folder first, then create a new folder
under that one.  An example of the Dupes texture folder for Quake II.
Sub-folders allows you to group your textures very specifically.

<i>Delete folder</i> Deletes the selected folder, either a main folder or
a sub-folder.  Note: it is a <b>bad idea</b> to delete the pre-defined folders
unless you know what you are doing ;-)

<i>Item Description...</i> Lets you type in a short description of the
folder.  This description is displayed next to the folder name.

<i>Reload folders</i> If you have copied or moved texture files on your
disk, Reload folders will refresh the texture display so that it matches
whatever your physical file structure is.  This is useful when you are
regrouping textures into different sub-folders.

<i>Add-ons...</i> Displays the list of registered add-ons and lets you
add or remove them.

<i>Close Toolbox</i> Closes the texture-browser window.
