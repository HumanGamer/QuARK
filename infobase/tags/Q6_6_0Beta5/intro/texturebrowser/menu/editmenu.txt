<i>Undo</i> Allows you to quickly and simply undo the last change.

<i>Undo/Redo</i> Presents the QuArK Undo/Redo window so you can select a number
of changes to undo or redo.

<i>Cut</i> Removes the selected item (folder, texture etc.) and places it into
the clipboard.

<i>Copy</i> Copies the selected item (folder, texture etc.) and places it into
the clipboard.

<i>Paste</i> Copies something from the clipboard into the texture-browser.

<i>Delete</i> Deletes the selected item (folder, texture etc.).

<i>Copy object as</i> Copies the selected item (folder, texture etc.) and
places it into the clipboard, but allows you to select from a second level menu
exactly what type of object you are copying.

<i>Paste special...</i> Prompts you to select what type of object you are
pasting, then copies it from the clipboard into the texture-browser.  The
Paste-special window is very similar to the Object-properties window.

<i>Import files</i> This will prompt you to select one or more files, and then
display them in the current folder.  If you link to the files, then only a
reference to the files is placed into the add-on, but if you move the actual
files later on they will no longer be available in the texture-browser.  If you
copy the files into the add-on, they will always be available, even if you move
or delete the original files, but your add-on will be a lot bigger.

<i><b>Open selection...</b></i> This is the default action if you double-click
somewhere, and opens a folder, texture, or selects a texture for use in your
map.

<i>External editor</i> Opens the external editor associated with the selected
object.  External editors are configured in
<ref> intro/configuration/general/externaleditors </ref>.

<i>Object properties...</i> Opens a window displaying the object's properties,
such as the type and size.  Also allows you to copy the item to the clipboard.

<i>Configuration...</i> Runs the <ref> intro/configuration </ref>.
