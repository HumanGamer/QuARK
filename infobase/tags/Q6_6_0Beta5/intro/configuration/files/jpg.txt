<i>Select library for loading JPG files</i>. Here you can select the library you
want to use to load JPG files.

<i>Select library for saving JPG files</i>. Here you can select the library you

<u>Advanced DevIL settings</u>

These settings only apply to DevIL, so they only work when DevIL has been
selected for the operation that is performed.

<i>Saving format</i>. Here you can select the format of the
saved texture. Warning: Not all formats are supported by all games!

<i>Saving quality</i>. Here you can select the quality of the
saved texture. The higher the better the quality, but also the larger the file
and the longer saving (and loading the texture in-game) will take.

<i>Save Progressive</i>. This will produce a progressive JPG file, which means the
texture is saved in several steps, going from low quality to high quality. When
loading, a low-quality texture is available to the game before the entire texture
is loaded. Support for this may be limited; best to not use this option unless
you're sure it works and you really need it.


<u>Advanced FreeImage settings</u>

These settings only apply to FreeImage, so they only work when FreeImage has been
selected for the operation that is performed.

<i>Loading quality</i>. Here you can select the quality of the
loaded texture. The higher the better the quality, but also the larger the loading
will take.

<i>Load CMYK</i>. Load separated CMYK 'as is'.

<i>Saving quality</i>. Here you can select the quality of the
saved texture. The higher the better the quality, but also the larger the file
and the longer saving (and loading the texture in-game) will take.
