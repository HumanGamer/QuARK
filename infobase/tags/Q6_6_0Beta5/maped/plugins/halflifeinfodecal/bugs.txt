title: Bugs

If you should experience any bugs, by using this Half-Life Infodecal Helper, please contact
<a href="mailto:decker@planetquake.com">Decker</a>.

<b>Notice:</b>
Its not a bug if the text appears mirrored, unreadable, every single letter rotated or upside-down.
This is because you haven't corrected the wall-texture rotation, upon which the infodecals will be
attached to. Please read a tutorial on infodecals first!
