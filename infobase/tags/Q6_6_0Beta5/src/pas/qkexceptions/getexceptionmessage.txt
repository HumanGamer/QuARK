title: GetExceptionMessage

<code>
function GetExceptionMessage(E: Exception) : String;
</code>

This function takes a generated exception, and strips the additional information from it and adds a point to the end (<tt>.</tt>).

The additional information is everything after a double slash (<tt>//</tt>), and is used by the exception handler for the MORE panel.

This function should be used instead of <tt>E.message</tt> whenever possible.
