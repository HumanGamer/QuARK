If you don't want to waste time, making rooms by the brick-by-brick method
(e.q. create a brush per wall/floor/ceiling), you should try out the two
macro-objects; Wall Maker and Hollow Maker.

Both objects can be found in the 'Duplicators & Misc.' folder.

Once created, a default brush is assigned to the object, but you can of cause
put more brushes into the Wall Maker-/Hollow Maker-object, like any other
brush-entity or group.

Both the Wall maker and Hollow maker, consists of solid-cube(s) and
negative-cube(s), but you only have to think about moving one.

Depending on which of the two objects you have created; Wall maker or Hollow
maker, the size of the room they make, are whats matters:

<ul>
<li>A Hollow maker, will take the brush(es) which are assigned to it, and create
a smaller room inside it.
<li>The Wall maker, takes the size of the brush(es) for given as the room size,
and then surrounds it with walls.
</ul>

The size of the walls are determined by the specific <tt>depth</tt>, which can
be found in both objects. To increase the thickness of the walls, increase the
value of depth.
