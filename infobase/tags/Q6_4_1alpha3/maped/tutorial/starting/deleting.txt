The default room is okay for test purposes, but usually you don't want to use
it at all, so how do you get rid of it?

Easy, by deleting it! Mark the three items in the
<ref> intro/mapeditor/dataforms/treeview </ref>, as shown in the
image, and either press the Delete key on your keyboard, or <tt>drag</tt> them
to the <ref> intro/mapeditor/misctools/trashcan \ trashcan </ref> icon
<img width=23 height=23 align=absmiddle>image4.png</img> and <tt>drop</tt>.

You must not, and can not, delete the 'worldspawn' item. This must exist in all
maps.

To select multiple items, QuArK's tree-view understands the common method as
every other Windows' program do. By holding down the Ctrl key on your keyboard,
and click on items will toggle between selected and unselected. (Just like in
Windows' File-Explorer.)

You can also select the first item of a list, then hold down the Shift key and
click on the last item, all items in between will be selected. (Just like in
Windows' File-Explorer.)
