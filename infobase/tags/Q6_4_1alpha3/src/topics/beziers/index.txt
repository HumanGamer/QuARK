title: Beziers
author: tiglari

For the math behind beziers, see <ref>src/pas/bezier</ref>. Here
I just say a bit about where some relevant Python code is.

The routines for Face-Bezier texture projections are
in quarkpy\b2utils, texPlaneFromCph and texcpFromFace.
The former is rather complicated; I think it might be
possible to clean it up using the Axis Base idea, but
anway the code as some comments.
