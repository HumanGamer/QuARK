QuArK writes maps in a considerable range of formats, but also has
the peculiarity of allowing (and indeed in certain ways promoting) the writing of
faces with non-integer coordinates.  This is considered to be profoundly
evil by some people, and can certainly cause problems, although I don't
think it's always so bad (especially for example with non-structural brushes).
At the least, it can create problems in using QuArK together with map
editors that don't tolerate floating point coordinates well.
