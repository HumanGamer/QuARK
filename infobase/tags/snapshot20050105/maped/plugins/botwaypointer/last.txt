title: The last part
author: Fredrick

When you are happy with your work, you can save it by clicking on the bot waypointer that is in the class list.

If you use alot of work, you can actually make waypoint navigation much better than the bot author himself, due to that you have
the advantage of overview the structure.

Tips: Dont lay down to many waypoints, this is explained in the bot readme. you can probably reduce almost half of the
waypoints on a map, by looking at the map structure, like a long hallway with no sidewalk dont need 30 waypoints but maybe only 15,
as long as a waypoint can "see each other, it is good enough", and the result is less cpu usage.

I will thank Decker for his great work on this project. Without him, my idea would have been still in dreamland :-)

Notice: This is still an experimental work-in-progress, there are lots of bugs, and alot more work has to be done.
