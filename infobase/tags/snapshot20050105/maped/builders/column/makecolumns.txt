title: Making columns
author: tiglari


There's only one menu item for columns & pipes,
Column.  As usual, resize the block to change the
shape of the column or pipe.  And there are lots
of specifics to experiment with.  For example you
can make a round porthole to fit into a square
aperture by checking inverse and unchecking open.

One difference between pipe/column and the other
shapebuilders at the moment is that for a pipe with
thickness, the outside texture comes off the wall labeled
`back', the inside off the one labelled `front', so they
can be different.

Unfortunately there isn't yet any facility for making
pipes that are bent, we need some kind of replication of
the functionality of q3radiant's `patch bend mode',
but don't have it yet.
