<b>Question:</b><br>
How do I apply decals over a texture?

<b>Answer:</b><br>
A decal is a special point-entity in Half-Life.

Create a <tt>infodecal</tt> point-entity (Look in the 'Info_ entities' folder),
and place it near the wall you want your decal to appear on (max 8 units from it, at Grid 1).

The spec/args view of the <tt>infodecal</tt> point-entity, contains a specific named "<tt>texture</tt>",
this you can change to any decal texturename - mainly the texture-browser's "Decals Folder".

<b>Note</b> that the decal-texture's scale and orientation is controlled by the brush-face upon
which the decal is applied. So if your decal-texture looks mirrored or large/small, then
is the brush-face's texture you need to mirror/scale.

The decal-texture's color is controlled by the decal-texture itself. If you want to change
it, you need to create a new decal-texture yourself.
