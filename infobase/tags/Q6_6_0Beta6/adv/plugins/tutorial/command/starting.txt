What we'll be doing is making a replacement maptagside plugin.
The real one is interconnected with some other plugins
which we'll have to disable, & it would not be a good
idea to mess with your regular QuArK installation, so
you should make a second one, and in that installation,
remove the files `plugins\mb2caulk' and `plugins\maptagside'.

Since we're going to be making a series of new maptagside
plugins, it might be convenient to call them maptagside0.py,
maptagside01.py; you can disable the older ones and keep
them from loading by renaming them `tagside0.py', etc
(since plugins are only loaded by the mapeditor if their
names begin with q- or map-, or mb2- for Q3 engine games).
