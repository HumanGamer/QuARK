function DisclaimerThread(F: TForm): THandle;
</code>

DisclaimerThread creates the flashing red disclaimer text on the splash screen and the about window. Call it with the window's handle, and it returns a handle to a thread it created that draws the flashing text.

Currently, only one disclaimer thread at a time is supported. Opening multiple can result in undefined behavior.

Don't forget to close the returned handle when you're done with the flashing text!
