title: How does QuArK compare to other map editors?
author: Gryphon, tiglari

QuArK handles more different kinds of resources with less fuss than any
other editing tool, and supports more games than most editors. However,
the question of which editor is 'best' is not one we care to get into.
The best editor for you is the one you can get
your projects completed with and like the most.
