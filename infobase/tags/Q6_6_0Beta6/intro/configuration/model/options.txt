A lot of things in the model-editor are controlled in this folder. A brief
overview will be given here, but you should experiment with the settings
yourself, to get a knowledge of what they do and if you can use them to
something usefull.

<i>Model Axis in views</i>. This displays the models axis on which it was built in all views,
showing its X, Y and Z direction. The size of its letter indicators and line thickness can be
increased or decreased by using the 'Set Line Thickness' function. Their individual colors can
be changed in the 'Configuration Model Colors' section.

<i>Grid</i>. Effects the display, visibility and activation of the editor's view grids only.
The <a href="intro.modeleditor.skinview.html#overview">Skin-view</a> has its own grid settings further below.<br>
<i>Cross-like cursor</i>. If you're doing precision work, its better to have a
cross instead of the arrow-shaped mouse-cursor.

There are numerous other items that you can set to customize the Model Editor to your choice.

<i>Co-ordnances</i>. This turns the function on or off to take co-ordnances for the
<a href="intro.modeleditor.skinview.html#overview">Skin-view</a> from the editors 3D view when new
objects are created using the <a href="intro.modeleditor.toolpalettes.objectmodes.html">
Quick Object Maker</a>. This also applys when taking a
<a href="intro.modeleditor.skinview.html#selection">Remap Snapshot</a> It will place that object
on the skin exactly the same way you see it in the 3D view when the object is created.
This same process applies to selected faces in the editor. Because the 3D view uses its own <g>scale</g>
factor, activating this function will also turn off the
<a href="intro.modeleditor.skinview.html#funcsnmenus">Use Skin-view scale</a> function and visa-versa.

<i>Grid</i>. Effects the display, visibility and activation of the
<a href="intro.modeleditor.skinview.html#overview">Skin-view</a> grid only.
The editor has its own grid settings further above.

This section applies strictly to the QuArK Model Editor's model import \ export logging system that is
available. It is optional as to weather it is used or not by the creators of those files. Holding your
mouse cursor over each item produces a <g>Hint</g> as to what its function is.
