<i>Wireframe</i> will change all map-views to show polyhedrons and entities as
wireframe-graphics. This is the fastest drawing-method of the map-views.

<i>Solid</i> will change all map-views to show polyhedrons as solid object.
This means that you won't be able to 'see-through' polyhedrons once they are in
view.

<i>Textured</i> will change all map-views to show polyhedrons with their
applied textures and alignment. It will also show 3D-models of entities, if
QuArK can find the 3D-representation.

<i>New 3D-window</i> will create a new free-floating 3D edit window. An 'eye'
with an angle-handle will be shown in the map-views, to illustrate from where
the camera sees the world. You can actually edit polyhedrons in the 3D-window,
and manipulate textures.

<i>OpenGL view</i>, does the same as the previous command "New 3D-window" but
the 3D viewer uses the OpenGL standard 3D graphic library. In QuArK v5.10 (and
higher) it is also the only way to preview (colored-) light effects.

<i>Show whole level</i> will in wireframe-mode, draw all lines the level
consists of, even those that can't be seen simultaneously in all map-views.

<i>Gray out of view</i> will in wireframe-mode, draw grey lines of those parts
of the level, which can't be seen within the map-views.

<i>Hide out of view</i> will in wireframe-mode, only draw lines for those parts
of the level, which is within the map-views.

<i>Panel at right</i>. Check this menu-item, if you want the compass, dataform
and that area, moved to the right of the map-views.

<i>Layouts</i>. These menu-item are used to change between the different
map-layouts.
