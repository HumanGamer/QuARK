Although a more 'Game Specific' (Quake 2) function, this particular menu item will lead you to a very powerful
and useful tool that deals with the entering and handling of game bots.


This menu items actual function is to paste a bot waypoint, a position point to control a bots movement through
a map, into the map.

To paste a bot waypoint, you must first have copied (CTRL+C) a single 'dup botwaypointerpoint' entity
into the clipboard.

This action also creates a new targetname for the waypoint, and keeps it aligned with the previous
waypoint selected.

Creating 'bot' type maps is supported with the installation and use of a special editor which is covered
in detail on its registering with QuArK, its functional applications and use in its own section of the
Infobase docs called the
<a href="maped.plugins.botwaypointer.html">Bot Waypoint Editor</a>.

To the right and below we are showing a 'screen shot' listing of the QuArK Configuration area that
handles this installation and registering step for QuArK.

For a quick and brief run down of these steps, go to QuArK's Configuration Games section and select Quake 2.

Click the 'Add-ons...' icon button to open the 'Game Configuration' window and click on its 'Add...' button.

The 'Add...' window will open and show a listing of all available .qrk file addons. From that list select the
BotWaypointer.qrk addon and click the 'Ok' icon button to register it.

You can now close all the open windows and proceed to the section below.

This is also covered in the <a href="maped.plugins.botwaypointer.html">Bot Waypoint Editor</a> section
with a more descriptive tutorial for its setup and use.
