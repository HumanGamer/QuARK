If you have selected more than one object in the map-views, you have already
seen the red linear handle circle. This 'handle' allows you to resize, rotate,
shear and move your selection.

If you want this linear handle circle to appear when you select only one
object, you must mark this icon.

It is <b>highly advisable</b> that you try to use the linear handle circle, at
least once, so you know what it can do. Keep in mind that holding the
mouse-cursor steady for a moment on one of the many small handles in the
circle, will bring up a little 'flyover' help.
