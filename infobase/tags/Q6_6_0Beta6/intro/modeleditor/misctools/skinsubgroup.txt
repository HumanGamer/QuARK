Creates a new Skins sub-group in the selected component's 'Skins' folder,
where you can place skin objects in, used for Quake1 animation skins.
If any existing skins are selected when this button is clicked
it will place all of those into the new sub-group for you.

This special folder exists because some model formats allow or require them.
