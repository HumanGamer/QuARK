This panel can contain Objects that you use most frequently for easy access and application.
Even though the panel might take an item it may not be all that practical.

To place an Object into this panel simply drag and drop it at the location you desire.
Items can be rearranged in the same manor of dragging them in front or behind other items.
You can always remove objects from the panel, by dragging them to the
<a href="intro.modeleditor.misctools.html">trashcan</a>
in the Misc tools section.

A brief description of the most common objects and how they might be used is given below.
