<g>Bounding boxes</g>, or bboxes, are fairly simple and straight forward.
They are a box area that surrounds the entire model, or sections of it, for each animation frame of that model.
Something like <a href="intro.modeleditor.editelements.html#boundframes">Bound Frames</a>
which is an old QuArK system that is not really used any more.

The existence of <g>bboxes</g> can be use for determining the collision or hit area of a model.

Method 1) can be done in a number of different ways in QuArK, the most basic is by giving just two vectors,
each consisting of three values representing an x,y,z point in 3D space.
One vector gives the minimum point and the other the maximum point.
Using these two vectors a 3D box can be created that encloses the model for that frame.
This is the method used by models with and without bones.

Two other methods, for models without bones, but may consist of one or more components, or sections, are:<br>
Method 2) creating a list of vertexes for each bbox that will be used to surround them from frame to frame<br>
Method 3) or creating a list of two distinct minimum and maximum vectors, as described above, for each individual frame.

Which ever method is used, the data is stored in the
<a href="intro.modeleditor.importexport.html#bones2">editor.ModelComponentList['bboxlist']</a>
using different key names.<br>
Method 1) uses editor.ModelComponentList['bboxlist'][bbox.name]['size']<br>
Method 2) uses editor.ModelComponentList['bboxlist'][bbox.name]['vtx_list']<br>
Method 3) uses editor.ModelComponentList['bboxlist'][bbox.name]['frames']
