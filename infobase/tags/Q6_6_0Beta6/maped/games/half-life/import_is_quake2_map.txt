title: Imported .MAP is a Quake-2 map?
author:

<b>Question:</b><br>
I have a problem while trying to load an Half-Life .MAP file which is
decompiled with WinBSPC v1.2 (BSP decompiler to map).

The problem is that QuArK is trying to load the .MAP file as Quake 2 map, even while Half-Life
game is being selected.
I think that something in the .MAP file cause QuArK
to think it is a Quake 2 map. (For example take the C3A1B.BSP decompiled
map file.)

<b>Answer:</b><br>
The problem is, that when WinBSPC 'encounters' an ORIGIN-brush, it is hardcoded to create
a brush with the texture
<tt>e1u1/origin</tt>.
When QuArK imports a .MAP-file, it scans it, and if
it finds a '/' in a texture-name, it thinks the .MAP is a Quake-2 map.

To solve this problem, you have to open the decompiled Half-Life .MAP file in Notepad or other
ASCII-texteditor, and search-replace
<tt>e1u1/origin</tt> with <tt>origin</tt>,
before you import it into QuArK.
