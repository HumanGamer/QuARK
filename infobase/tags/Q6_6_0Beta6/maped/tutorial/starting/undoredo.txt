Before moving on, let's look at the <ref> intro/mapeditor/misctools/undoredo \ undo/redo </ref>
facility in QuArK. This would be a good time to test it, as we are
experimenting deleting the default room.

You activate the undo/redo window, by either clicking on the icon
<img width=24 height=23 align=absmiddle>image6.png</img>, or from the
<tt>Edit</tt> menu select <tt>Undo/Redo...</tt>

In this window, you can see what QuArK allows you to undo and/or redo. You can
<u>not</u> do a selective undo or redo, so it's better to get some knowledge
about how it works. There is also a limit on how much thats available to
undo/redo, see <ref> intro/configuration/general/memory </ref>.

Try to undo your 'delete selection'. Now the default room and all came back
again. You can then redo the 'delete selection'. Try it.

Try to experiment with deleting all items, one item at a time, from the
tree-view, and then open the undo/redo window.

Remember to look at the shortcut keys in the menus ('Ctrl+...' and 'Shift+...')
and in <ref> intro/configuration/map/keys </ref>.
Using these will not only give you a faster work-flow, but also reduce the
risk of getting physical-disabilities due to using the mouse too much.
