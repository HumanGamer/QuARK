title: Why doesn't QuArK have this really cool feature?
author: tiglari, DanielPharos

Very likely some combination of laziness, stupidity, or pressure; or
perhaps nobody has asked for it.  So if you think it would be cool,
ask for it.  If nothing happens after six months or so, bring it up
again; QuArK was developed by a different person then the present
maintainers, and we are gradually learning how to do more thing with
it.

Also, you could try to make it yourself. The sourecode to QuArK is
freely available, and we will always welcome a new developer :-)
