<i>Add Vertex Here </i>&nbsp;: This will add a single vertex to the currently selected model component
(and all of its animation frames) to make a new triangle. You need 3 new vertexes to make a triangle.
You can also make a new triangle by creating just one or two new vertexes and then use pre-existing
vertexes to complete the group of three. Then select each vertex using the RMB menu when your cursor is
over one of the vertexes you wish to use. Once all three have been 'picked' then RMB click on any open
area (area that the model is not in) of any view to get the
<a href="intro.modeleditor.rmbmenus.html#viewsrmbmenus">Editor Views RMB menus</a>, covered above,
and select 'Commands' then 'Add Triangle'. This can be done from the editor's main 'Commands' menu as well.

<i>Remove Vertex </i>&nbsp;: This will remove a vertex from the component and all of its animation frames.
WARNING, if the vertex is part of an existing triangle it will ALSO remove that triangle as well.
If this does happen and is an unwanted action, simply use the Undo function to reverse its removal.

<i>Pick Vertex </i>&nbsp;: This is used for picking 3 vertexes to create a triangle with. It also works in
conjunction with the <b>Clear Pick list</b> below. You need 3 vertexes to make a triangle. Once all 3 have
been 'picked' use the <b>Add Triangle</b> funciton on the
<a href="intro.modeleditor.rmbmenus.html#viewsrmbmenus">'Commands' sub-menu</a>, covered in detail above,
to create a the triangle.

<i>Clear Pick list </i>&nbsp;: This Clears the 'Pick Vertex' list of all vertexes and it becomes active
when one or more vertexes have been selected. The list can contain a maximum of three individual vertex
selections to do two things with, <b>Add Triangle</b> or <b>Delete Triangle</b> which are both commands on
the <a href="intro.modeleditor.rmbmenus.html#viewsrmbmenus">'Commands' sub-menu</a> covered in detail above.
Once a vertex has been 'picked' it will be displayed in all views as a larger and different color vertex
then those not 'picked'. If a vertex that has been 'picked' is picked a second time it will be removed from the
list and return to its normal appearance and another vertex can then be selected to take its place in the list.


<i>Force to grid </i>&nbsp;: This will cause any vertex to 'snap' to the nearest location on the editor's
grid for the view that the RMB click was made in.

<i>Coordinates... </i>&nbsp;: Clicking on this menu item will open the coordinates <b>Enter position</b>
dialog box which does two things, first it gives the view location of the vertex, and second you can enter
a new set of coordinates to move the vertex that was under your cursor when the <g>RMB</g> click was made
to relocate that vertex to an exact position on that views grid.

<b><u>Special Notes:</u></b>

Once a new triangle(s) has been created it still needs to be <b>Skinned</b> on the
<a href="intro.modeleditor.model.html#mesh">Skin-view page</a> for proper viewing and completion of the
triangle. At first, the new triangle(s) will not appear on the Skin-view, you will only see <b>ONE</b>
new vertex located at the top left hand corner of the 'base' skin texture position. Click on the vertex
and move it on the Skin-view. As you do you will see the next vertex of that triangle and so on until
you have moved all of the new vertexes and triangles to their proper skinning location.
