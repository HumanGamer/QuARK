title: Selection & Navigation Methods
author: cdunde

<i><b><u>Selection Methods </u></b></i>: Two different selection methods have been designed into the
QuArK Model Editor for the <a href="intro.modeleditor.skinview.html">Skin-view page</a>. Also see the
Model Editor's <a href="intro.modeleditor.overview.html">Overview</a> page
<a href="intro.modeleditor.overview.html#selection">Selection & Navigation Methods</a> for the editor's particular methods.

<i><g>LMB</g> Vertex Handle Drag</i> : This method is available when your cursor is directly over a model
components <g>Skin</g> mesh <g>vertex</g> (point) <g>drag handle</g> and the cursor will change in appearance when it is.
Holding down your <g>LMB</g> will allow you to <g>drag</g> that particular vertex to a new location in the view,
changing the appearance of the model for that particular <g>component</g>. A specific <g>animation frame</g>
<b>does not</b> need to be selected for this function to work.

<i><g>LMB</g> Rectangle Selector</i> : This method is available when the cursor is <b>not</b> over a <g>vertex</g>.
Holding down your <g>LMB</g> and moving your mouse will produce a <g>Red Rectangle</g> selector that you can
drag across the Skin-view. This selector will allow you to make a multiple selection of a model components <g>Skin</g> mesh
vertex points at one time. These vertexes can then be passed on to the
<a href="intro.modeleditor.model.html#components">Editor views</a> or will be done so
automatically if you have activated one of the options on the Skin-view
<a href="intro.modeleditor.skinview.html#funcsnmenus">RMB menu</a>
(which you can obtain by clicking your <g>RMB</g> in the Skin-view) or the main
<a href="intro.modeleditor.menu.html#optionsmenu">Options menu</a>
for <a href="intro.modeleditor.skinview.html#funcsnmenus">Skin-view Options</a>.
As the Model Editor is developed, this selection method will be used to move and edit whole sections of the model's <g>Skin</g>
mesh by use of its selected <g>vertexes</g>.
To <g>de-select</g> any and all vertexes, simply do another small <g>Rectangle drag</g> in any unused area of the Skin-view.

<i><g>LMB</g> & <g>RMB</g> Selector</i> : (not activated at this time, reserved for future use and functions.)

A couple of other issues about all of the selection methods described above:

1) Once a selection has been made the Skin-view <a href="intro.modeleditor.skinview.html#funcsnmenus">RMB menu, 'Vertex Commands'</a>
will become active for its items use.

2) How and what a selection will select is also linked to the
<a href="intro.modeleditor.skinview.html#funcsnmenus">Vertex drag mode</a> button above the actual viewing area.
Meaning, either single depth or full depth selection of the vertexes can be made depending on the mode that button
is set to at the time. Once a selection has been made,
the <a href="intro.modeleditor.skinview.html#funcsnmenus">Vertex drag mode</a> can be changed to work with your
selection in various different ways. A little experimentation will assist you in learning these differences.

<i><b><u>Navigation Methods </u></b></i>: The <a href="intro.modeleditor.skinview.html">Skin-view</a> navigates
much like it does in the rest of the Model Editor,
<a href="intro.modeleditor.model.html#components">2D views</a> and is covered in detail below.

<i>Skin-view viewing area</i> : Using your <g>MMB</g> you can <g>Zoom</g> in and out for the 2D viewing area.
Press and holding your <g>RMB</g> will allow you to <g>Scroll</g> or <g>Pan</g> in that same view.
All other combinations are used as described above in the
<a href="intro.modeleditor.skinview.html#selection">Selection Methods</a> section.
