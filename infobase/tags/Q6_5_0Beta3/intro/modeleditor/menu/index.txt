New commands are constantly being added to the all menus. If there is
no F1 help for some command, or you can not understand
what it says, post to the <a href=http://games.groups.yahoo.com/group/quark/>QuArK
messageboard</a> for help (and a heads-up to the docco writers).

Most of the commands on the menus also have hot keys (accelerators), which
you can customize from Configuration at the bottom of the
<ref>intro/modeleditor/menu/optionsmenu</ref>.
