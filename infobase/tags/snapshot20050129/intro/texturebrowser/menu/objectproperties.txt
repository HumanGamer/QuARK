Displays some properties about the selected object, from the <i>Object
properties...</i> or <i>Paste special...</i> menu options.

The window shows the object pathname, the file type and size, and then a list
of types the object can be converted to, and a button to copy the object to the
clipboard or paste depending on where the window was displayed from.

The <i>Save as...</i> button allows you to save the object as an external disk
file. Useful if you want to play with the file outside the QuArK environment.
