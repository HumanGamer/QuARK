Across the top is the menu and toolbar, this is covered in more detail in the
<ref> ../menu </ref> section.

Down the left of the form is a list of texture groups.  The ones shown here are
from Quake II, yours may differ depending on which game you are editing, and
whether you have setup any additional texture groups of your own.

Most of the form is taken up with a preview of all the textures in the selected
group.
