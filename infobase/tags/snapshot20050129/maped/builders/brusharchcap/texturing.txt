title: Texturing the arch

Arches get the textures for their front and back faces
off the front and back faces of their guide brush.  So all
we have to is to tag some face of the wall (assuming the other
wall bits are properly aligned), then select the front face
of the arch's guide brush, and then <act>RMB|Project Texture from Tagged</act>.
and ditto for the back wall.  The results should look more or
less as to the right (the red line is the part of the outline
of the wall-face that the texture was projected from).

If your arch's front or back textures are misaligned, you should fix them now;
if they're not, mess them up and then fix them.

The inside of the arch is unfortunately not so straightforward.  It
would be nice if there was some way to wrap the texture on the front
or back onto the inside curve, but there isn't, at least without using
specially pre-prepared and proportioned textures.  So we basically
are stuck with a misalignment here, which can be ameliorated
by using some fairly bland, unpatterned texture on the inside
faces.

But what we can do is get the textures aligned around the inside
of the archway.  The inside faces get
their texture off the top face of the guide-brush.  So basically
what we want to do is wrap that texture onto the two walls.
But somehow everything has to get aligned.  What happens is
that texture is compressed and positioned in such a way that
if the same texture is projected to the top face of the hole
and wrapped down the wall, everything lines up.  So first
put a bland texture on the top face of the guide-brush.
This will produce something like what's to the right, not
very good because of the different texture appearing at
the very top and sides:

</td></tr>
<tr><td valign=top>

So Next, tag the top face of  guide brush, then the bottom
face of the brush that's at the top of the whole, and
<act>RMB|Texture|Project from tagged</act>.  Then the quickest way to wrap
down the sides is to select the sides of the whole, and
<act>RMB|Texture|Wrapping|Wrap from tagged mirror</act>.  The result
ought to look like this:

</td></tr>
</table>

In the game, the joins may be unpleasantly visible, due to light
effects, but if there is an arghrad-like editing tool, this can
be fixed by putting the same lightvalue (or equivalent property)
onto the top face of the guide brush and the other faces forming
the opening.  The top-brush's lightvalue (& all other specifics)
will be copied onto the inner faces of the generated brushes.

If you put an appropriately patterned texture around the inside
of the arch, and look closely, you'll see
that the texture scale is compressed somewhat on the curved portion;
that's because its being positioned and scaled on the curve so
that it will join up smoothly with what's on the walls, but
the distance around the flat wall face is longer than on the
smooth curve-face.  This is because of a bit of tricky coding
in the duplicator, whereby the texture scale is compressed
just enough so that the distance in texture-space around
the curve equals the distance, w.r.t the top-face scale, around
the three faces defining the arch.
