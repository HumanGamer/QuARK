title: Duplicator Combinations
author: tiglari

Various kinds of effects can be produced by using
more than one duplicator in a combination.
There are two kinds.

First, more than one (standard) duplicator can be put into
the same group.  What will happen then is that each will
produce copies according to its own type and specifics.
So if you want for example to arrange the copies in
a cross shape, along the X and Y axes, you could use
four basic duplicators, with offsets '256 0 0', '-256 0 0',
'0 256 0' and '0 -256 0'.

The second is more interesting.  A standard duplicator makes
copies of everything in the group that contains it.  What
if one of those things is itself a group with a duplicator?
It turns out that the pattern made by the lower duplicator gets
copied by the higher one, so that for example we can make not only
rows, but grids.  So for example to make a grid with 5 rows and
10 columns, you could use 2 Basic Duplicators, one with count
5, arranging things down the Y axis, and another with count 10,
arranging them down the X axis.

We can use this technique to get the effects of some additional
Mirror-type duplicators.  For example if we wanted an XYZ mirroring,
we could use a Z Mirror and and XY Mirror.
