title: Some theory
author: tiglari

Now I think a bit more background on what's going
on would be a good idea.  Basically what a duplicator
is doing is looking inside of itself (duplicators
can contain things just like brush entities do),
and also inside of the (smallest) group it is in,
and executing some code that specifies additional
structure to make, on the basis of what it sees,
and what it's specifics are.  This code is specified
by the 'macro' specific, so you can transmute one
kind of duplicator into another by changing that.

Then the 'out' specific specifies whether or not the
duplicator looks at the stuff in the group that
contains it (value 1), or only inside itself (no value).
The difference between these two possible locations
is finally that the stuff inside the duplicator is
not put directly into the map, but only provides data
for the duplicator's calculations.  You can test
the effect of this by moving the brush inside the
duplicator; when the brush itself is not selected,
it will vanish from the map views, but the copies
(blue outlines) will remain visible.
