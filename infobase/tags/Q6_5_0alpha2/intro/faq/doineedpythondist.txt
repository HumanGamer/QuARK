title: Do I need a Python distribution installed to run QuArK?
author: Peter Brett

If you're using a Windows binary snapshot or distribution of QuArK more recent than the beginning of June 2003, QuArK comes with the Python interpreter and all the libraries you need included.

If you're compiling from source, you have the option to compile for a version of Python you have installed on your system.  Please see <ref>src/topics/pyversions</ref> for more information.
