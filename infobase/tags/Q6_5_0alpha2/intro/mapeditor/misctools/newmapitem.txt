Opens the new map items window, in where you will find many different objects,
usefull when creating a map.

This window contains all objects thats possible to use in the map-views and
dataform-display.

The top-folders, also known as main-folders, are here marked in bold. Some of
these folders might come from <g>add-ons</g>, others are somewhat static.

You can drag objects from here, and drop them on the <ref>../userdata</ref>, so
you will have quicker access to them.

It is <b>highly recommended</b> that you familiarize yourself with these items,
for the <g>FPS-game</g> you are building a level for. There might be prefabs
here, which you installed with an <g>add-on</g>.

See how you install add-ons in the QuArK Explorer.
