title: Putting a Command on a Menu
desc: starting import action menu register

A plugin needs to do four things:

<OL>
<LI>Get noticed by QuArK
<LI>Import resources from the rest of the program
<LI>Define the actions that the plugin will perform
<LI>Provide menu commands, buttons or some other facility for the user to initiate the actions
</OL>

And it should also register itself. So we'll do these five
things in turn.
