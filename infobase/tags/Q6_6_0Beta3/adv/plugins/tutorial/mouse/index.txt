title: Right Mouse Menus
desc: basic elaborate

Our commands work, but the interface is clunky because we have to select
our sides, and then cruise up to the command menu (or remember a
hot key, which are in limited supply) to get the effect.
A popular strategy to make things easier is to put commands on
a `speed menu', or RMB menu, which is brought up by clicking
the right mouse button when the cursor is over the object
we want to act on.
