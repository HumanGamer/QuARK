It is also possible to have a structure that is
replicated, or 'tiled', along the length of the
corridor.  Any such things are placed inside
a group named 'Tile', which is treated specially:
brushes in this group don't have their front and
back faces stripped off, & the entire contents
of the group is copied along each branch of the
path as many times as the entire X-axis length
of the stuff in the Path Duplicator will fit
(the contents of Tile are treated just like other
contents of the Path Duplicator for working out
the size of the template).
