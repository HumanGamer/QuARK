<img border=0 align=right>polyhedronview.png</img>
When you have selected a polyhedron, you can see some information and change
settings for it, in this view.

<i>Faces</i> shows how many faces (sides) this polyhedron consists of.

<i>Center</i> is the X,Y,Z coordinate in the level, where this polyhedron
exist. You should not change this manually, unless you don't want to move the
poly in the map-views.

<i>Texture</i> shows the currently applied texture to this polyhedron, as well
as a list of used textures in the level, so you quickly (?) can change to
another, without opening the texture-browser.

<i>Owned by</i> displays the name of the group or entity, in which this
polyhedron exist.

The icons above the texture from left to right:

<table border=1 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=2>
<tr>
  <td valign=top align=center>
    <i>Texture</i>
  </td>
  <td>
    This icon will open the Texture browser so you can select a different
    texture for the selected polyhedron.
  </td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td valign=top align=center>
    <i>Negative</i>
  </td>
  <td>
    When this icon are pressed, the selected polyhedron will become a
    <g>negative poly</g>; it will dig holes into other polys, without actually
    doing a <g>brush-subtraction</g>.
  </td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td valign=top align=center>
    <i>Face-flags</i>
  </td>
  <td>
    <img border=0 align=right>faceflags.png</img>
    Some FPS-games have special face-flags to control different behaviour, like
    transparensy, water, warping, etc. When you click this icon, a new window
    will appear, in where you can set the flags for all faces of the selected
    polyhedron.
