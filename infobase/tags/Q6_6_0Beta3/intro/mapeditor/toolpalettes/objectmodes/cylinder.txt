<I><u>Quick cylinder maker</u></I>:  Clicking this button allows you to draw cylinders on the map with the left mouse button and each cylinder will be turned into an actual poly.

This can make angled sides or a more curved style cylinder by adding more faces.<br>
Move the mouse forward to add more faces, backwards for fewer faces, right to make it larger and left to make it smaller.<br>NOTE: Less than 3 faces will not draw anything.

Increasing the amount of its <a href="intro.mapeditor.toolpalettes.objectmodes.html#dialogboxes"><i>Object Distortion Dialog</i></a> will increase its height.<br>
Giving a negative amount will make it shorter.
