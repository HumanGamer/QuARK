<i>Open</i> works just as in the QuArK-Explorer. You can open any file with
this, to apply it to your <g>project</g>.

<i>Save</i> will save your current project to an <g>.QRK</g> file.

<i>Save in QuArK Explorer</i>. Use this if you want to add this map to your
current project. This way, you can have multiple revisions of a single map, in
a single project. Just remember to give them a sensible name, so you can
distinguish them. At the moment (QuArK v5.7), the map editor will automatically
close itself when you use this menuitem.

<i>Save as file</i>. If you want to export just this map to a <g>.MAP</g> or
<g>.QKM</g> file, select this menuitem.

<i>Save all</i> will save all opened files. This includes the current project
and modified <g>add-on</g> data files.

<i>Close</i> will close the map editor.
