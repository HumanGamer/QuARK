These buttons will allow you to <g>freeze</g> any one, or combination of, the editor's views
during animation and continue to animate any view that is re-activated by clicking on its
button once again.

The <ref> ./fps </ref> speed that are animated may be effected by the number of views that
are frozen and\or different items that are also being drawn such as face outlining.

The icons for each view, from left to right, are:
<ul>
<li><i>3Ded</i> : The editor's <g><b>3D</b></g> view.
<li><i>X</i> : The editor's <g><b>X Back 2D</b></g> view.
<li><i>Y</i> : The editor's <g><b>Y Side 2D</b></g> view.
<li><i>Z</i> : The editor's <g><b>Z Top 2D</b></g> view.
<li><i>3D</i> : The editor's <g><b>floating 3D</b></g> view.
</ul>
