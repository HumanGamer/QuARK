When active along with one of the paint tool brushes, such as the
<a href="intro.modeleditor.toolpalettes.paintmodes.html#solidcolor">Solid Color Paint</a> tool,
you can <g>pick</g> a color to set the paint brush to use by clicking the <g>LMB</g> on a pixel in any of the editor's
textured views or the Skin-view.

If the <a href="intro.modeleditor.toolpalettes.paintmodes.html#airbrush">Airbrush Paint</a> tool
is active, doing a click on a pixel using your <g>middle mouse button</g> will
set the <g>second, or lower, color</g> of the airbrush as well. A <g>LMB</g> click over a pixel in any of
the editor's textured views or the Skin-view will set its <g>primary, top or start, color</g> setting.

Activated by itself, without one of the paint brush tools, will stop the <g>LMB</g> single click
component selection function and the <g>MMB</g> auto zoom function. All other functions will remain
in effect and active. Meaning you can edit and paint without having to change modes.

Also, the color that is <g>picked</g> comes directly from the skin texture and not the view itself,
which avoids any possible view settings distortion of that color.
