title: Color Selector & Paint Settings
author: cdunde

<img  border=0 align=right>colorselector1.png</img>

This button opens the dialog to select colors manually from either a palette,
if the model uses one, or the RGB color selector.

There are also various other settings for all of the paint brush tools.


Basically, all of the painting tools and functions are still very much in the development stages
(which we could use assistance with).<br>
Meaning, you may get some strange results at times so be sure to have a backup of your skin textures.
Although, unless you save the model or texture, any painting changes will not be saved automatically.
Still, it is a matter of good editing practice to get into. Now to cover the specific items of this dialog.

<I><u>current skin</u></I> : This will display what ever skin is currently selected and it will update
itself if another skin should be selected.<br>
<I><u>reach through</u></I> : Because a model may have other components on top or below your work area
and other factors, using this function will allow you to <g>reach through</g> those laired faces and
get to the ones you want to paint.

<b>Solid:</b> These are primarily the settings for the
<a href="intro.modeleditor.toolpalettes.paintmodes.html#solidcolor">Solid Color Paint</a> tool.
However, they also apply to the
<a href="intro.modeleditor.toolpalettes.paintmodes.html#airbrush">Airbrush Paint</a> tool.
<I><u>Palette color</u></I>&nbsp; and <I><u>RGB color</u></I> : If a model texture has a palette,
such as <g>Quake 2</g> models do, the <g>Palette color</g> will be active, if not then the
<g>RGB color</g> will be active. Both are never active at the same time, the program makes the selection.

<I><u>Brush Width</u></I>&nbsp; and <I><u>Brush Shape</u></I> : These are the settings for the
<a href="intro.modeleditor.toolpalettes.paintmodes.html#solidcolor">Solid Color Paint</a> tool only
with a preset list for its shapes.

<b>Airbrush:</b> These are settings strictly for the
<a href="intro.modeleditor.toolpalettes.paintmodes.html#airbrush">Airbrush Paint</a> tool appling to
its <g>secondary color</g>, its <g>primary color</g> is above.<br>
<I><u>Palette color</u></I>&nbsp; and <I><u>RGB color</u></I> : If a model texture has a palette,
such as <g>Quake 2</g> models do, the <g>Palette color</g> will be active, if not then the
<g>RGB color</g> will be active. Both are never active at the same time, the program makes the selection.

<I><u>Spray Width</u></I>&nbsp; and <I><u>Spray Shape</u></I> : These are the settings for the
<a href="intro.modeleditor.toolpalettes.paintmodes.html#airbrush">Airbrush Paint</a> tool only
with a preset list for its shapes.

<I><u>Spray Style</u></I>&nbsp; and <I><u>Opacity %</u></I> : At this point <g>Spray Style</g> is purely
experimental which can result in some rather unpredictable results, use this with caution.
The test settings are <g>Spray Width</g> at an even value number, <g>Spray Shape</g> set to <g>RECTANGLE</g>,
<g>Opacity %</g> set to a low numeric value (10 or less) and with the painting being done in the
<a href="intro.modeleditor.skinview.html">Skin-view</a>.

<I><u>Opacity %</u></I> : This is very useful in spreading a color blend between the
<g>primary (start)</g> and <g>secondary (end)</g> color spread.

The QuArK Development Team is very interested in the assistance of others either in the way of pixel color
formulas, methods and\or coding to further enhance and improve these functions. If you feel you can
contribute please contact us.
