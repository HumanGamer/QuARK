Painting in the <a href="intro.modeleditor.skinview.html">Skin-view</a>
works a little bit differently then in one of the editor's textured views.

In one of the editor's views if you go outside of the models mesh area it will simply stop painting the texture.
However, in the <a href="intro.modeleditor.skinview.html">Skin-view</a> this is not the case because this view
gives you the <g>tiled</g> effect of the texture and will therefore continue to paint in that tiled section.

You will also notice that what ever is painted in one tile is duplicated in all of the other tiles until infinity.
This is the way texturing is really suppose to work but most other editor's do not display these tiles,
which can be quite an asset when you want to duplicate a section without having to lay one part of the model's
mesh over another and another and another making it very cumbersome, if not impossible, to relocate or paint
those duplicated areas.

You will also notice that when painting in the <a href="intro.modeleditor.skinview.html">Skin-view</a>
the speed at which the texture is painted is much faster then painting in one of the editor's views.
Yet, what ever you paint in the <a href="intro.modeleditor.skinview.html">Skin-view</a> will also
appear in the editor's view and visa-versa.

This in its self is another nice feature in that you can jump back and forth from the editor and the
<a href="intro.modeleditor.skinview.html">Skin-view</a> as you are working. It is especially fast
if you are working with two monitors on your system, if not, it works just as well having the
<a href="intro.modeleditor.skinview.html">Skin-view</a> pulled to one side which will remain on top
of the editor and not constantly get lost behind it.

Another difference between the <a href="intro.modeleditor.skinview.html">Skin-view</a> and the editor's
views, especially in OpenGL mode, is that it gives only a <g>pixel</g> by <g>pixel</g> image to work with.
Meaning that it will not be distorted or appear fuzzy, blend the pixels together, in any way.

Again, this is an added feature that allows you to pretty much see how the painting of that texture will
be effected when it is used in the game itself.

Other then those few variations, everything else works pretty much the same.

One vital point to remember is that when painting in the editor's views you always have the option to
make one, or more, of its <g>2D views</g> a <g>Textured</g> view which will give you an additional perspective
to work from.
