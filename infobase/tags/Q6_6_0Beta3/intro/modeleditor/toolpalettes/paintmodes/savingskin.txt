Saving an individual skin texture at any time takes three simple steps.

<g>First step</g>: open the Texture Browser and, from the <g>Used Skin Textures</g> group,
select the texture that you want to save.

With your cursor over that texture do a <g>RMB</g> click to bring up a menu and select
<g>Properties...</g>
</td></tr>
</table>

<table border=0 cellspacing=0>
<tr>
<td valign=top>
<img border=0 align=left valign=top>savingskin2.png</img>
<g>Second step</g>: The <g>Object properties</g> window to the left here will open up with the current
image type already selected.

Now selected <g>Save as...</g>

<g>Third step</g>: This will lead you to the saving of the texture file using the
<g>Save file as...</g> window that appears on the right here.

Select the location where you want to save the texture, rename it if you want and click <g>Save</g>.

Of course, when you save the entire model using one of the <g>Main</g> menu's <g>File</g> items,
any and all painted textures will also be saved with that model.
