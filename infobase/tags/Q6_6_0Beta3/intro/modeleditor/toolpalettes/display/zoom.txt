This button also has two parts. The left will bring down the menu, where you
can select a zoom-factor. The right part will, when no objects are selected, fit
the entire model into view. When a object is selected, you can click one time
to zoom to selection, and click again to fit the entire model into view.

You can also use keys to zoom in or out. See
<ref> intro/configuration/map/keys </ref> for these.
