A model is a single <b>QuArK Internal Object</b> that can consist of a single or multiple <g>components</g>.
Each component usually has its own <g>skin texture</g> image such as a .pcx, .jpg, .tga or similar type of file.

<img border=1 align=right>overview1.png</img>

The purpose of the <ref> ../skinview </ref> is the application of various functions to correctly position the
model's <g>skin mesh</g> over its <g>skin texture</g> giving that finished look to the model. This is done with the use
of <g>drag handles</g> created at each <g>vertex</g> or point of each <g>triangle</g> of the <g>skin mesh</g>.

The <g>skin mesh</g> is an <g>unwrapped</g> layout, or shape, of a model's <g>component</g>.

To the right is a screen shot of the Skin-view page displaying the <g>skin mesh</g> of a model that only has
one <g>component</g>. Only one <g>skin</g> can be viewed and edited at a time. The Skin-view consist of three areas.
The top part displays information about the <g>skin mesh</g> and the <g>texture</g> image being used. Just under that is the
Skin-view's button section that perform various different functions. These are covered in more detail latter.
The third section is the actual <g>Skin-view</g> that displays the <g>mesh</g>, <g>skin</g>, <g>drag handles</g>
and <g>RMB</g> menus when called upon. Now for their descriptions and other important information on their uses.

<b><u>Selected Skin section</u></b>

<i><u>Triangles </u></i>: This give the number of triangles that make up the <g>skin mesh</g> or <g>Tris</g>
Each triangle has tree <g>drag handles</g>, one at each of its points and that overlap other triangles <g>drag handles</g>.

<i><u>Owned by </u></i>: This gives the name of the current component of the model that has been selected in the
<g>Tree-view</g> of the model editor and is currently available for editing.

<i><u>Skin </u></i>: This gives the name of the current component's <g>skin</g> of the model that has been selected in the
<g>Tree-view</g> of the model editor and is currently being used for the model. A model can have a single <g>component</g>
or multiple <g>components</g>. And each <g>component</g> can have a single <g>skin</g> or multiple <g>skins</g>
that it can use.

<i><u>Skin size </u></i>: This gives the actual size of the texture image displayed in <g>pixels</g> or sometimes known
as <g>texels</g>.

<b><u>Skin-view display section</u></b>

As stated earlier, this section actually shows the <g>mesh</g>, <g>skin</g>, <g>drag handles</g> and <g>RMB</g>
menus when called upon. It is also the editing work area for skinning the model. Something that you will notice
here is how the <g>skin texture</g> is repeated over and over again with red color outlines.
This is called <g>Tiling</g> and goes on indefinitely. Most other model editors do not show the <g>skin texture</g>
in this manner, yet it still exist and is usable. We chose to show it in its true fashion to assist you in
various aspects.

Some models have been skinned by over-laying parts or half of the <g>skin mesh</g> over the top of the other,
to conserve texture file size and\or match the texturing exactly. This method is beneficial at times but it
can also be awkward as well. By displaying the <g>tiled</g> areas, you can easily relocate any part of the
<g>skin mesh</g> you choose to another tile section rapidly and with great accuracy in QuArK's Model Editor. 
<img border=1 align=right>overview3.png</img>

This is possible because of the way we have constructed the Skin-view to operate. Notice in the two screen shots
to the right how the <b>help box</b> of the model editor displays not only the triangle (tri) and
<g>vertex-index</g> number of the handle the cursor is about to grab for dragging, but it also gives you
the exact location of its position on the base tile of that texture by its <g>x: +52 y: -2</g> amounts.
As you drag that handle to another tile section of that texture those same co-ordnances will be displayed
in real time along with their <b>original</b> position as a reminder. So you simply drag to that same location
on another tile section.

In addition, this feature works in the same manner weather you are doing a multi-drag or a single drag by using
the <g>Vertex drag mode</g> (covered below).

Which brings us to another group of functions and <g>modes</g> selection buttons to assist you in your work with vertexes and their relocation.

The <g>RMB</g> Skin-view menus are covered in the
<a href="intro.modeleditor.skinview.html#funcsnmenus">Functions & RMB Menus</a>
section further down.
