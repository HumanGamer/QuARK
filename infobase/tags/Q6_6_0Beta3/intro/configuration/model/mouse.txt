To get the most out of the model-editor, you can specify here how the mouse
should act when you do certain operations to it, like pressing a button and
dragging.

It is <u>highly recommended</u> that you familiarize yourself with these
mouse-settings, or <u>redefine</u> them if you like. But you should experiment
with them in the model-editor, to get a feel of what they are doing.

However you should be aware that the mouse-modes default settings have been made
to work with various elements of the editor and Skin-view and changing these
settings could adversely effect how they work together.
