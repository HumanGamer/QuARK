<ul>
<li><u>A suggestion for people who are new to using Quark:</u>

Adding '+sv_password foo' to the Half-Life command line entry in 'configuration' will
keep people that compile a map for the first time having other people popping in to play.

It's quite a shock when you compile your first map and while looking at it, someone
else suddenly appears.
</ul>

<ul>
<li><u>How to insert entities in HL2 map:</u>

Make sure you are in HL2 mode, and create a new map, then do the following:

Go to [options:configuration], and then choose Half-Life2 under the Games section.
Where you see a button called "Add-ons", click it. You should see 3 items:
DataHL2.qrk, textures-hl2.qrk, and entities-hl2.qrk. If you don't see these,
click on "Add", and then browse on your computer to where these are (they should be
in the QuArK folder, in another folder called "addons"). After you do this, you
should see two blue cube buttons in the upper left of QuArK's window. The one on
the right should be a list of entities when you click it.
</ul>

<ul>
<li><u>I can't see the textures inside QuArK for Half-life 2, what is wrong?</u>

There can be many problem's , here are something you can do.

<li>1: The account name must be written in lower case only. User = user.  - Reported by Matrikular
<li>2: Check if steam is running, close QuArK close steam. Load steam again then start QuArK
<li>3: SDK content needs to be installed, from steam.
</ul>

<ul>
<li><u>Everything was working perfectly, but then steam did an update<br>and I cant use QuArK anymore
?</u>

Delete the SDK content folder, and let steam reload these ones.
</ul>

<ul>
<li><u>QuArK says, it can load some basic models, but where are they?</u>

Go to addons folders, and plugins. Choose Half-life 2 models.
</ul>

<ul>
<li><u>When I adjust the scale of a brush instead of following the grid snap<br>
I'm finding its adding an extra unit proportionally to the size<br>
of the brush (e.g. +64.02, rather than +64)?</u>

You most likely have forced the grid into a custom setting, simply change it manually back to 64.
</ul>
