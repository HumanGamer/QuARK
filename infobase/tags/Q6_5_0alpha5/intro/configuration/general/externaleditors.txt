You can select there your preferred program for editing various file types that
itself QuArK won't let you edit.

Each box can be empty (no program), or <b>&lt;open&gt;</b> to call Windows'
default programs for this file type, or a complete program path to call a
specific program. Other commands in square quotes like <b>&lt;edit&gt;</b> may
be available depending on the program.

If a box is left empty but QuArK knows how to convert to another data type, the
conversions are done automatically (e.g. if you leave the .wal box empty but
fill the .bmp box, when you want to edit a Quake 2 texture (.wal), QuArK will
convert it to .bmp, call your program, and convert it back to .wal after you
edited the image).
