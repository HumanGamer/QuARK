This button also have two parts. The left will bring down the menu, where you
can select a zoom-factor. The right part will, when no object are selected, fit
the entire level into view. When a object are selected, you can click one time
to zoom to selection, and click again to fit the entire level into view.

You can also use keys to zoom in or out. See
<ref> intro/configuration/map/keys </ref> for these.
