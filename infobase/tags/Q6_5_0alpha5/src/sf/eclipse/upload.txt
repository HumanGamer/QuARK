<i>Committing Files:</i>

<b>Commit</b> a file means that you are uploading it.

To upload a file, right-click it, on the popup menu go to <b>Team</b> and then select <b>Commit...</b>.

Note also the <b>Synchronize with Repository</b> option - this compares your local files with the files on the CVS server and shows you graphically the differences.

Just to reiterate, before you commit anything using Eclipse, make sure you <b>ALWAYS</b> 
go to the resource perspective, right-click on the modules you are 
going to commit (you can hold down the Ctrl key on the keyboard and 
left-click to select multiple files/directories), and <b>select Refresh</b>. 
Eclipse doesn't know that you have changed anything outside of Eclipse 
unless you tell it to refresh.

When you see what has changed (a ">" will be added in front of the 
directories and files that have changed), select everything that has 
changed (you can select each module, e.g. "source", "infobase" if you 
like), right-click again, select "Team" from the popup menu, and from 
the submenu select "Synchronize with Repository...".

That will compare your files with those in the repository, and show you 
any changes you have made that are outgoing, changes other people have 
committed that are incoming, and any conflicts (where someone has 
committed a file that you have also modified).

You can then select to commit all your outgoing changes, update all 
incoming changes, and you can double-click each conflicting file to see 
where the conflicts are, and to update your local file with changes made 
in the repository before you commit your file.

<i>General Comments:</i>

If this information is of use, and a positive response is received about using 
Eclipse to access the QuArK source, Rowdy will probably expand on this with a 
few more examples, and hints on using Eclipse.
