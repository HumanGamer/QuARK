title: Attributes common to Internal objects of class "3DObject"
author: Armin Rigo
format: html


<p>Here are the additionnal attributes of Internal objects with "3DObject" in their class tuple. The Internal 3D Objects are the ones that have some kind of 3D position or shape. All objects present in the map editor’s tree view are Internal 3D Objects. This includes groups because you can move and resize whole groups.</p>

<table border=1 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=4>

<tr><td class="doccode">
origin
</td><td>
The origin point for the object, as a read-only 3D Vector.
</td></tr>

<tr><td class="doccode">
translate(v)<br>
translate(v, grid)
</td><td>
Translates (moves) the object by adding the vector <span class="doccode">v</span>. If <span class="doccode">grid</span> is set and is not zero, the origin of all objects is then forced to this grid. Note that the vector <span class="doccode">v</span> does not have to be on the grid. To move an object by a distance which is a multiple of the grid step, first round <span class="doccode">v</span> to the grid and then call <span class="doccode">translate</span> with no <span class="doccode">grid</span> argument.
</td></tr>

<tr><td class="doccode">
forcetogrid(grid)
</td><td>
Forces the object to the grid. If the object is a group, all objects in this group are individually forced to the grid.
</td></tr>

<tr><td class="doccode">
linear(v, m)
</td><td>
Applies the linear operation given by the matrix <span class="doccode">m</span> by using the point <span class="doccode">v</span> as center (fixed). See <span class="doccode">qeditor.py</span> for functions that build matrices for common operations such as rotations.
</td></tr>

<tr><td class="doccode">
inflate(z)
</td><td>
Inflates the polyhedron(s) by <span class="doccode">z</span> pixels. <span class="doccode">z</span> can be negative. When applied to a single face, the face is simply scrolled by <span class="doccode">z</span> pixels perpendicularly to its plane.
</td></tr>
