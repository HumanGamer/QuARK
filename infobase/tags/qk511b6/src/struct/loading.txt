title: Loading files

Here are comments that will help you in writing support for a new file type.

QuArK has got a complex file management structure, but you need not be aware of it as long as you use the "official" way of loading and saving files. Doing so will let QuArK handle things such as loading or saving directly inside a .pak file, and load-on-demand.

To support a new file type, a class inherits from QFileObject and overrides some key methods. The first one is TypeInfo, which should return the file extension. QuArK recognize files based on their extension only, and then invokes the correct class' Charger method. ("Charger" = "To Load" in french). This method must process the file it receive in a parameter and turn *all* information it contains into Specific/Args and subobjects.

For example, the method Charger of QMapFile parses the map file and creates the whole hierarchy of groups, polyhedrons and entities.

Some file types are suitable for load-on-demand, which is implemented through subobjects whose class also has a Charger method. For example, when loading a .pak file, it is of course not completely loaded into memory : the directory of the file is processed, and folders and subfolders are created accordingly. The files inside the folders are also created but this time through the method LoadedItem, which may be called from a Charger method only. It creates a subobject which is marked as "not loaded yet"; this subobject's own Charger method will be called when necessary to actually load the (sub-)file.

In summary, the method Charger must :

<p><li>load every information contained in the file and store it all as Specific/Args and subobjects, with one exception : calls to LoadedItem, which does not immediately load the data;
<li>don't do anything else (no direct disk access, no display, etc.), with one exception : calls to LoadSibling, to access files besides the one currently loading (typically, Quake 2's models and sprites refer to .pcx files for the model skin and sprite images).
</ul>
