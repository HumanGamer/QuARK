<I><u>Quick sphere maker</u></I>:  After you click this button, you can draw spheres on the map with the left mouse button and each sphere will be turned into an actual poly.

Move the mouse forward to add more faces, backwards for fewer faces, right to make it larger and left to make it smaller.<br>NOTE: Less than 3 faces will not draw anything.<br>
Over 20 faces will 'freeze' QuArK but it will return.
