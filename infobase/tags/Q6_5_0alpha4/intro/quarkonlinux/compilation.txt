title: Compiling a Map under Linux
author: slightcrazed, Peter Brett

For one reason or another when you run 
<act>[GAME] | GO! (textures+build+[GAME])</act> it will only run the
first build tool. So you may have to run the BSP, VIS, and RAD
portions manually.

It may be necessary to create a shell script to do the compile process
externally to QuArK, and then reconfigure the menu to point to it.
Please see your build tools' documentation and the man/info pages for
your shell for more information.
