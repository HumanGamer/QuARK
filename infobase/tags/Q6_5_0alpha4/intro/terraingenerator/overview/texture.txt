title: Texture
author: cdunde

Now that you have created your terrain surface, it is time to do some texturing to it. The texture that it starts with is the default texture that is set in <a href="intro.configuration.games.specificgames.html">QuArK's Configuration Settings</a>. You could, just as easily selected your texture prior to creating the terrain all together. Sometimes this may be desirable as a base and other times it may be better to apply it last or even <b>during</b> the creation process. Here, we will apply it now that the terrain <ref>../shaping</ref> has been completed.

To start with, select the desired area or, as here, the entire terrain surface. You can use the <a href="intro.terraingenerator.selection.html#basicselector">Terrain Selector</a> that you have been using thus far, but only the <g>faces</g> that are movable will receive texturing. If you wish to texture the entire <g>polys</g> then you must use one of <a href="intro.mapeditor.toolpalettes.mousemodes.html">QuArK's  Standard Selectors</a>.

<tr><td valign=top align=middle>

</td></tr></table>

Then open <a href="intro.texturebrowser.overview.html">QuArK's Texture Browser</a>, select your texture as you would for any other <g>poly</g> and basically your terrain is complete!

</td></tr></table>

Another powerful tool is the <a href="intro.terraingenerator.texture.html#paintbrush">Texture Applicator & Dialog Box</a> which in effect is a combination selector and "paint brush" function.

For complete detail of its applications and uses please go to the <a href="intro.terraingenerator.texture.html#paintbrush">Texture Applicator & Dialog Box</a> section of the <a href="intro.terraingenerator.texture.html">Texture</a> page.
Where even more functions (that are not shown here) of the dialog box are displayed and explained in detail including the <b>Tough-up Tool</b> section of it.

Just as a quick, and maybe crude, example. Below is showing how two sections of terrain surface can be combined to make a simple scene consisting of one section, the base water and hilly area, and the second section, the cave, that was created from a new terrain section by starting with the <a href="intro.terraingenerator.selection.html#basicselector">Basic Selector</a> to get a hollow curved structure and then working on the basic shape with the <a href="intro.terraingenerator.selection.html#touchup">Touch-up Selector</a> to shape the opening, detail the interior and exterior then finally using the <a href="intro.terraingenerator.selection.html#paintbrush">Texture Applicator</a> to apply the textures desired for that finished look ! If you noticed, we just moved right on down the line of the toolbar. Enjoy ! ... ;-) ... cdunde
