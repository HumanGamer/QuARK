title: Extend Selection

This appears as a submenu for faces, and an item for polys and groups.
The face submenu has subitems `To Adjacent Faces' and `To Linked
Faces'.  The first extends the current selection to faces that
are exactly coplanar to the selected face, and share an edge with
it, and likewise to further faces adjecent to these in the same
way.  So that if the floor of a room is selected, and there is
a say a pillar whose bottom is flush with the top of the floor,
the bottom face of the pillar will join the multi-selection with
the floor.  -- if it works, which it doesn't always, for reasons
I haven't figured out.

Extend Selection to Linked Faces on the other hand just extends the
selection to other faces that are linked with the currently selected
one, as described in the description of the <!-- <ref> maped/plugins/tagside </ref> --> plugin.

For groups and polys, there is currently only extend selection from
the currently selected poly to faces that are adjacent to faces
in that group or poly, so that if you drag the poly, these faces
will be dragged along with it (I think it's better to drag faces
instead of whole polys, but when I took this off the menu someone
wanted it back, so here it is again).
