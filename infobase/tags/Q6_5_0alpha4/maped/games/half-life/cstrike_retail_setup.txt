<b>Question:</b><br>
How do I setup QuArK for the Counter-Strike retail version?

<b>Answer:</b><br>
<table border=0 cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0>
<tr><td>
First go into your Counter-Strike disk-folder, and create a file named
<tt>HL.EXE</tt>. This is a file which QuArK looks for, to make sure that it
found the correct Half-Life folder, but we'll need to fool it into thinking
that it found Half-Life.
<br><br></td></tr>

Next, go into QuArK's configuration, and change the <act>Games|Half-Life</act>
settings to what is shown in the image here:
<ul>
<li>Change from <tt>HL.EXE</tt> to <tt>CSTRIKE.EXE</tt>
<li>Change the Half-Life directory, to point to your Counter-Strike retail
directory
</ul>
</td></tr>
<tr><td>

Finally you'll need to create a <tt>Game Context</tt> object in QuArK Explorer,
to tell QuArK that it should not create a <tt>tmpQuArK</tt> disk-folder, but
run all .MAP/.BSP from the <tt>CSTRIKE</tt> disk-folder (which is also the
Counter-Strike retail main-base disk-folder, as <tt>VALVE</tt> is for
Half-Life.)
</td></tr>
