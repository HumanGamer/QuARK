title: Advanced Basic Duplicators
author: tiglari

Two quick observations.  The first of the two
duplicators named Duplicator, with macro 'dup basic',
has an angle specific which seems to twist and
displace the copies in a manner which I have yet
to find any use for (if someone has a use for this,
they should submit the appropriate revision to
the help here).

The second, with macro 'dup linear', has a specific
'linear' consisting of 9 numbers, being by default
<table><tr><td>
1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1
</td></tr></table>
This is a 'linear matrix' (written as one row of 9
rather than 3 of 3), a mathematical technique
for specifying deformations in space, the idea is
that each copy is deformed from the previous one
as specified by the matrix.  Most mappers aren't likely
to be able to do much with raw matrices, but one
trick is to scale the images.  For example if we
replace all the 1's with, say, .9, then each copy
will by .9 times the size of the one before it:
<table><tr><td>
.9 0 0 0 .9 0 0 .9
</td></tr></table>
You can also scale by different factors in each
dimension by replacing the 1's with different numbers,
for the X, Y and Z scales in that order.

Matrices can do much more than this (especially
rotations), but somebody would probably have to write
a convenient GUI editing tool in order for mappers
to get much use out of them.
