title: Making bevels
author: tiglari

Bevels are currently introduced on both the Curves
and Brush Curve RMB menus for polys, just like
arch & cap.  Presently there are two types that
can be introduced direction, Left Corner and
Right Corner; then varieties can be created by
setting specifics.  The Left corner curves from the
left side of the guide-brush to the back, the Right
corner from
the right side of the brush to the back.

For different orientations there's lower and standup
specifics (the latter instead of onside), also inverse
and thick (presently only patch-based).  There's
also subdivide, to control the quality of the
circle-approximation, and inner for brush-arches.

Texturing is similar to arches; the texture
on the curve is projected from the back face, and onto the
top and bottom 'flanges' from the top and bottom faces.
In particular, suppose you want to align a texture on the
bevel to make a smooth curve walls forming a corner?

 First,
fit a brush into the corner, and then, looking along a wall
intothe corner, make the brush
left or right bevel as appropriate.  Next,
tag one of the wall-faces,  and wrap texture from tagged onto the
other wall.  Then RMB on the back face of the bevel-builder
(the face whose name is back), and texture|wrapping|from tagged
mirror. (And if it's patch-based, don't forget to caulk!)
