title: Instance Duplicator

The instance duplicator is intended for use when making
large numbers of copies of an object, in irregular patterns.
It is organized in the same way as the path duplicator,
making copies of the things within it, and this original
template does not appear in the map.  It also uses the same
system of path points as the path duplicator,
and in an instance duplicator is put into a group with
a path-duplicator, the contents of the instance duplicator
will be dropped at the path-points (turning points of the
path).

The instance duplicator itself has a 'centering' button,
if you push it, a 'usercenter' is added, which will be
what is actually positioned at the path points (and so can
be used to offset the template by some set amount from
all the path points).  It also has a 'track' specific,
which will cause the instances to be rotated to follow
the path.

And finally, there are some path-point specifics for use
with the instance duplicator: noinstance prevents an
instance from being generated, while the scale/rotate/matrix
specifics work as they do for the Linear Duplicator, but on
the instance at that point, relative to the template.
So the instances can be scaled and oriented differently,
at the different path-points.

The way the orientation works is a bit tricky: each subitem
of the instance duplicator is transformed around its own
center, and can be a group with its own usercenter.  So
subitem of the duplicator can have one usercenter, used for
rotating it around with the scale etc. attributes of a
path point, while the duplicator itself has another usercenter,
used for locating all of the subitems w.r.t. every path point.

Well maybe this is too complicated, but I guess it's flexible!
