title: Curves (Patches)
desc: basics quilts texmanag

Curves are one of the major new features of the Quake3 engine.
Q3 curves are implemented mathematically as things called 'quadratic
bezier patches' (one of many different kinds of 'parametric
curve'), but happily you don't have
to know anything about the math to use them in map-editing.
