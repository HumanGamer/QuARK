Say you have a lot of brushes on top of each other, which from one of the
2D-views makes it look like only one brush is visible, as shown in the image.

How would you select the second brush, if you only were allowed to click in the
2D-view, which showed only <i>one</i> brush?

Simple, keep on mouse-clicking.

QuArK has this functionality, that if you click a second time on a selected
brush, it searches for another brush which lies deeper 'into the screen' so to
say. If one can be found, it will be selected.

Try it out. Make some cubes, and place them as shown in the image. Then try to
select them one by one, by clicking in the 2D-view which displays only
<i>one</i> of the cubes.
