title: Distribution and Aftermath
author: tiglari

Once things get into a useable state, or possibly even before,
somebody with SourceForge access will start committing your stuff to
the repository, and it will begin to appear in snapshots.

By `aftermath' I mean that if you initiate QuArK support for a game,
people will tend to expect you to fix bugs in the game data, etc., and
there always are some, so this can drag on for a while.  People will
also expect you to be able to answer basic questions about the peculiarities
of editing the game, so if you don't want to assume the mantle of a guru,
it's better to keep quiet and just use Radiant...
