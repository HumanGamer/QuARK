Here you will find information, gathered from various places, about map compiling errors.

Usually the build sequence, which result in a final .BSP file from a .MAP file, are split into phases;

<ol>
<li>BSP - take the .MAP textfile and calculate a fullbright, non-optimized .BSP file.
<li>VIS - optimizes the .BSP file, so the game's graphics-engine does not have to draw everything.
<li>RAD - calculate (colored-)lights in the .BSP file, using information from the BSP and VIS phases.
</ol>

However, not all QuArK supported games use the same build phases. Some might contain more or fewer phases,
and maybe also in a different sequence.
