title: How to make a hollow cylinder/pipe
author: Decker

The fastest method, but also the one that creates the most mess for the build-tools, is to create one normal cylinder and one
that is smaller which will be used as a negative/digger cylinder.

Unfortunatly this fast method, have a tendency to sometimes create irregular faces at the ends, as shown in this screenshot:

If you really care about your face-count, you should create the normal cylinder as <b>pie-slices</b> instead. This is
recommended if the players also can see the <u>outside</u> of the hollow cylinder.
