title: Blue color problem (Ladder texture)
author: Decker

<b>Question:</b><br>
How do I use texture alphas?  I made a ladder, and the ladder
texture had a blue background which I would imagine is supposed to be
the see through area, but when I compile the maps the
blue shows as part of the ladder texture.

<b>Answer:</b><br>
A Half-Life ladder consist of two brush-entities:

1) <tt>func_ladder</tt>, which is invisible but is the area where the player should
be able to climb on "a ladder". This brush-entity usually have the <tt>AAATRIGGER</tt>
texture applied to it, since its invisible in the game.

2) <tt>func_illusionary</tt> (or any other non-solid brush-entity), which is the visible
indication of "here is a ladder".

If you use any of the "{"-character prefixed texturenames (from the "Rails(2D)" texture-folder),
then you can get rid of the blue-color by altering the <i>renderfields</i> of <b>any</b> brush-entity to:

<code>
rendermode      SOLID
renderamt       255
</code>
