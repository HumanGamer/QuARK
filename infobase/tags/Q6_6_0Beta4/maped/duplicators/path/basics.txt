When you select the path duplicator from
New Polyhedrons|Duplicators & Misc and drop
it into the map, you see the red 'group selected'
square plus a lot of dotted outlines.  That's
because a group is what has been dropped into your
map, and therefore selected.  If you look at the
group in the treeview, you'll see that it contains
one Path Duplicator, and three Path Points.
If you then select the Path Duplicator, a bunch
of handles will become visible, one regular
duplicator handle, and three squarish ones,
which appear to be located at the 'bends' in
a structure.  Drag them around & you'll see that
this is indeed the case.

Plus you can RMB on these handles to get menu items
to remove them, and add new ones, thus getting
lots of control over the shape of the path.

The path of what?  It's actually a tube, defined
by an ordinary positive brush and a negative one,
you can see them by expanding the Path Duplicator
and then inside of that the group named Template.
What's happening is that the brushes inside the
duplicator are taken as defining the cross-sectional
outline of the shape we're going to make, with
the X-direction being lengthwise.

The brushes don't have to be inside of the Template
group, and there can be duplicators there as well,
so the cross-section could involve some complicated
structures (it could be a row or grid of pipes,
for example).
