function OpenSplashScreen : TForm;
</code>

OpenSplashScreen creates (and displays) the QuArK splash screen and returns its <tt>TForm</tt>. Do not forget to release the splash screen when it it not needed anymore, because it will NOT auto-close!

Also, please don't open the splash screen without a good reason to do so.
