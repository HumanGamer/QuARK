<LI>Line 1370: A range check error sometimes occurs, for instance
in STVEF game mode. e is always between 0 and 15, so the range error
doesn't occur in mask_bits[e]. I'm not sure what exactly is causing
it, but the error appears to be non-critical.

Remark: The ZIP and UNZIP modules are a mess. Somebody should replace
these with more up-to-date libraries that have the same (or more)
functionality.
