title: Math Background
subdir:  vectors linear

Map editing involves a substantial amount of 3D math;
here is some
brief discussion of various aspects of the background.
It would be cool of the discussion could be followed on
the basis of high school trigonometry, but it's almost
certainly
not there yet, especially without pictures; if you start,
go on fine for a while and then get stuck, it would be
useful to know where.
