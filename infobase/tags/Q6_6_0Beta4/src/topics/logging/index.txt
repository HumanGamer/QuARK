title: Logging
author: danielpharos

<u>From the Delphi code</u>

To output information to the QUARK.LOG, use the Log-call defined in the
Logging.pas file.  There are several ways it can be called. The first
parameter is optional and indicates the part of the code trying to log
an item.  It is of the TLogName type:

TLogName: LOG_DEFAULT, LOG_PASCAL, LOG_PYTHON, LOG_SYS, LOG_DEBUG.

The second, also optional parameter indicated the severity of the item
to be logged.  All calls to Log with a level equal or lower to the level-
setting will be logged, the rest will be ignored.  The default logging
level is 20.  To set the log level, see the information about Environmental
variables below.<br>
The rest of the parameters is the information to be logged.  This can be
either a single string, or a string with format information followed by all
the variables to put in.  See information about the Format function in
Delphi.

Internally, QuArK uses aLog to actually output the information to the log
file.  This procedure should not be called directly.

<u>Environmental variables for Logging</u>

QuArK reads several environmental variables to control logging.  These are
not set via a configuration file, because a problem with the file could
cause a failure to create a logfile.  Environmental variables can be set in
the operating system.  The following variables are related to logging and
can be set:

QUARK_LOG_FILENAME: The name of the file to log to.  This file will be
cleared when QuArK starts up.<br>
QUARK_LOG_PATCHNAME: The name of the log of a patcher.  Shouldn't be used
anymore.<br>
QUARK_LOG_LEVEL: The log level of QuArK. See above in the 'Delphi code'
part for a description.
