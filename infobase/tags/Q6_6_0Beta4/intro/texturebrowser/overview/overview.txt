Across the top is the menu and toolbar, this is covered in more detail in the
<ref> ../menu </ref> section.

Down the left of the form the first item you will see is the
<a href="intro.texturebrowser.menu.html#texturesearch">Searched Textures</a>
folder.This is where any textures will be placed when you use the
<a href="intro.texturebrowser.menu.html#texturesearch">Search tool</a>,
shown at the far right of the toolbar.

Next comes the <g>Used Skin Textures</g> folder. These are all the textures that are
curently being used in the map or model as the case may be.

Below that is a list of texture groups.  The ones shown here are
from Quake III Arena, yours may differ depending on which game you are editing, and
whether you have setup any additional texture groups of your own.

Most of the form is taken up with a preview of all the textures in the selected
group.
