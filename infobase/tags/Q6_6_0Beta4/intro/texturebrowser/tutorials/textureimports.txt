title: Texture Imports, how to create
author: cdunde

1) First, make sure that the textures you want to import,
have been extracted from any game compressed files such as pak or zip files.

Then in QuArK, open the texture-browser, and choose 'New main folder'.

2) This will bring up a dialog-box where QuArK asks you, in what .QRK file you
want to store the new texture-links.

If you have the textures in a special game-directory, like a TC/PC/MOD, I
suggest you choose the option 'In a new Add-on'.

If you already have some custom textures from before, you can choose 'In an
already registered Add-on', so you don't end up with multiple .QRK add-ons, but
for this tutorial we will select the 'In a new Add-on'.

3) Now that you have selected 'In a new Add-on', QuArK will ask you to name
the new .qrk file that will be created.
Keep the file in your QuArK main directory, along with the other .QRK files, so you
can always find it again. Also remember to save it before you uninstall QuArK for an
updated version in the future.

4) In the texture-browser tree-view, there will now be a new main folder, called
'New Folder'.

5) You can rename this folder (and others as well), by highlighting it and press
the F2 key (just like in Windows' File-explorer) or just click twice on it.

6) While still having selected the new main folder (now called 'Action Quake 2' for this example),
click on 'Edit' in the menu-bar, go to 'Import files' then 'Import (copy) files...' and click on it.

7) The file to import window will open. Use it to navigate to your texture locations and click on
one you wish to import. You can only import one file at a time. If you have a lot of files and folders
then you should try to use the
<a href="intro.texturebrowser.tutorials.html#texturelinks">Texture Linking</a> method instead.

To keep things organized, it's a good idea to setup <u>sub-folders</u> before or as you import textures.
The 'new sub-folder' can be found in the 'Folders' menu.
When one is added it will show up in the Texture Browser tree-view as 'New Folder' but can be changed
to any name you choose. Which ever folder is selected when you import a texture, that is the folder
it will be placed into. You can also drag textures from folder to folder as you please.

Once you have them arranged the way you want it's a good idea to make a 'new texture list'
for each of the folders you have. This will cause all the textures in a particular folder
to be displayed as thumbnails when the folder is selected.

You create a 'new texture list' by selecting a folder with imported textures
then click the 1st icon button in the right-most set of icons of the menu
(if in doubt, always read the fly-over help).

This will place another folder called 'Texture list' in that folder which you will
rename to the same name of the folder it is in, ex: rename 'Texture list' to 'actionrally'.

Now <g>LMB</g> drag all those textures into the <b>NEW</b> 'actionrally' folder,<br>
then <g>LMB</g> drag that folder outside of the <b>OLD</b> 'actionrally' folder.<br>
Finally, do a <g>RMB</g> click on the <b>OLD</b> 'actionrally' folder and select 'Cut'
on the menu to remove that folder.<br>
Now when you click on the <b>NEW</b> folder you will see its textures thumbnails.

9) The final step is to close QuArK completely. As it shuts down you will see a message asking if you want to save the
changes to your new addon .QRK file, click "yes". Restart QuArK and you will see the newly imported textures.

If you look in QuArK's main folder you will also find your newly created textures .QRK file, which needs
to stay where it is or you will break where QuArK expects it to be.

Once again, <b> remember to save it before you uninstall QuArK for an updated version in the future.</b>
You should be able to use the same Addon .QRK file in the new version.
