<i><u>Triangles </u></i>: This give the number of triangles that make up the <g>skin mesh</g> or <g>Tris</g>
Each triangle has tree <g>drag handles</g>, one at each of its points and that overlap other triangles <g>drag handles</g>.

<i><u>Owned by </u></i>: This gives the name of the current component of the model that has been selected in the
<g>Tree-view</g> of the model editor and is currently available for editing.

<i><u>Skin </u></i>: This gives the name of the current component's <g>skin</g> of the model that has been selected in the
<g>Tree-view</g> of the model editor and is currently being used for the model. A model can have a single <g>component</g>
or multiple <g>components</g>. And each <g>component</g> can have a single <g>skin</g> or multiple <g>skins</g>
that it can use.

<i><u>Skin size </u></i>: This gives the actual size of the texture image displayed in <g>pixels</g> or sometimes known
as <g>texels</g>.

    <i>Remap Snapshot</i>
  </td>

In the skin texture-view below the icons, there are a number of <g>vertex</g> handles,
one for each point of each <g>skin mesh</g> triangle. These handles can be moved and
manipulated a number of ways, see the <a href="intro.modeleditor.skinview.html">Skin-view page</a>
section for more detail and available <g>RMB</g> menus.
