<i><u>Face Cut tool:</u></i> (first button of the two)<br>
When this button is active, at least one frame and faces of a model component have been selected,
a <g>LMB</g> drag can be made to produce a red cut line, like in the map editor, across them.
Where the line crosses it will divide each face into 3 individual triangles.

To cancel the cutting, press the <g>RMB</g> <b>&</b> <g>LMB</g> together then let go.
This can be done at any time.

Different cut patterns can be achieved sometimes, depending on the selected faces mesh structure.
To test it out click on the <b>Reverse face direction</b> button two times, once to reverse them and
once again to reverse them back to the direction they were facing before.
This can rearrange their individual vertex order thus causing the change in the cut pattern.
If you do not like the results just use the
<a href="intro.modeleditor.menu.html#editmenu">Undo / Redo</a>
function to the point before the faces where flipped.

<i><u>Keep Dupe Vertexes:</u></i> (second button of the two)<br>
This option ONLY works with and applies to the 'Face Cut tool'.
The default setting is inactive, causing all duplicate vertexes to be combined when a face is 'CUT'
so that the new faces do NOT pull apart.
When ACTIVE (on) all common vertexes of the new cut faces CAN be pulled apart for further editing
(to extrude, leave open, add new faces to and so on).
At any time they can be 'WELDED' together using the
<a href="intro.modeleditor.rmbmenus.html#vertexrmbmenu">Merge Vertexes</a> function.
