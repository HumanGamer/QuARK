Once selected, click this button to extrude in any of the editor's views,
but the best control is done in one of its <g>2D views</g>.
Each time a new drag is made a new set of faces, or vertexes, will be created from that starting position
to the position at the end of the drag with the new faces, or vertexes, selected.
Switching from view to view between drags will change the extruded drag direction.

<i><u><g>Face mode </i></u></g>:  Extrude with bulkheads
This does the same function as the <ref> ./extrudeselectedfaces </ref> but leaves <g>bulkheads</g>
between each extrusion drag.
This function only works with selected <g>faces</g> in the Editor's views and the
<a href="intro.modeleditor.toolpalettes.display.html#linear">Linear Drag Handles</a> button <b>is</b> active.<br>

<i><u><g>Vertex mode </i></u></g>:  Extrude all edges
This function only works with selected <g>vertexes</g> in the Editor's views and the
<a href="intro.modeleditor.toolpalettes.display.html#linear">Linear Drag Handles</a> button <b>is not</b> active.<br>
It will perform the same function for all edges that have been selected,
including ones that share two common vertexes.At least two vertexes of the same triangle must be selected.
If an improper vertex selection has been made it will attempt to correct that selection or notify you
if it can not.
