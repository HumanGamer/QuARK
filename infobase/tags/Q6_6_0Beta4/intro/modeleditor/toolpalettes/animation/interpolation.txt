This button will activate or de-activate the interpolation (give smooth animation)
of the selected model component animation frames.

Interpolation calculates additional movement positions between two frames
and draws them to smooth out the movement between those two frames.

To return to regular animation mode you must click this button to turn 'Off' the interpolation function.
