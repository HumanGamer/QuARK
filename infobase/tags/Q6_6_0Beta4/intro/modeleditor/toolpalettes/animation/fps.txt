FPS or frames per second is the setting as to how fast or slow the selected model component
animation frames will be drawn in the <ref> ./viewselector </ref> of the editor.

You can select a preset menu fps speed, use the arrows to the right of the menu
or click on <g>Other...</g> to get the <g>Custom FPS</g> dialog box to pop-up
to set your own speed.

The up arrow will increase the fps by one and the down arrow will decrease the fps by one on each click.

For the <g>Custom FPS</g> dialog you must press the <g>Enter key</g> for the fps amount
to become active.<br>
Clicking the X button will only close the dialog box without changing the setting.

Any of these methods can be used while the frames are being animated and will change that animation rate.
