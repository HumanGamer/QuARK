This button will activate or de-activate the animationCFG of the selected model component
animation frames.

Only used for .md3 <g>Player</g> type models with tags and a <g>animation.cfg</g> file in its folder.

You must select one Tag with the CFG text which would be a <g>torso</g> tag
and have imported all sections of that model, which will cause the <g>animation.cfg</g> file
of that model to also be loaded for the animation to become available.

To return to regular operation mode you must click this button to turn 'Off' the animation cfg function.
See the section on <a href="intro.modeleditor.editelements.html#tags">Tags System</a> for further detail
of their use and functions.
