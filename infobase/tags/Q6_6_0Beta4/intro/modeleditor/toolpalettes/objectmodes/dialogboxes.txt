title: Dialog boxes
author: cdunde


At this time there are two <a href="intro.mapeditor.toolpalettes.objectmodes.html#dialogboxes">dialog input boxes</a>
for the <a href="intro.mapeditor.toolpalettes.objectmodes.html">QuArK Quick Object Makers Toolbar</a> that are linked
to the <a href="intro.mapeditor.toolpalettes.objectmodes.html#dialog">Object Dialog Input button</a>.<br>
When an <a href="intro.mapeditor.toolpalettes.objectmodes.html">Object Makers Toolbar</a> button is selected and this
dialog button is clicked, the proper dialog box for that object maker will open.<br>
All amounts that are set for any dialog box will still be active even if that dialog box is closed.<br>
All of their settings will also be saved when QuArK is closed and remain the same when QuArK is reused.<br>
All dialog boxes can be moved, resized and will remain open until manually closed.<br>
Both dialog boxes can remain open at the same time and are active on the particular object makers that they relate to.

<I><u>Object Distortion Dialog</u></I>: This is a basic dialog input box that is used by every object maker on the
toolbar unless a specific one has been created for that particular object maker.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Distortion</b>:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clicking on the 'up' arrow will cause the object to be stretched, or elongated,
from its normal shape. Clicking on the 'down' arrow will do the opposite and cause it to shrink or be squished.
If set to '0', then it will have no effect and the object will be crated to its normal default shape. It has no
effect on how many 'rings', sections, or faces that an object will have. That is done by the actual dragging process
or a 'custom' dialog box possibly.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Make hollow</b>:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Checking this box will make the object hollow
when the LMB is released, no end faces. This function only applies to the Pyramid and Cylinder Objects.

When not activated (unchecked) end faces will be created for the Pyramid and Cylinder Objects
to allow extrusion and vertex manipulation to create shapes such as arms and leg parts.

Clicking the 'X' will close any dialog box.

<I><u>Torus Distortion Dialog</u></I>: This is a custom dialog input box that only relates to and effects the torus
object maker. The basic dialog box, covered above, has no effect on the torus object. Many shapes can be created from
a torus using one or more of these input items.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Segments\Faces</b>:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Segments - using the left and right arrows will add or reduce that number of
sections or 'rings' that a torus would normally have.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Faces - using the up and down arrows will add or reduce that number of faces
per section that a torus would normally contain.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Hole\Seg size</b>:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hole size - using the left and right arrows will increase or reduce the radius
of a torus, making its 'hole' larger or smaller.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seg size - using the up and down arrows will add or reduce the radius for the
sections of the torus, making it taller or shorter.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>X\Y distortion</b>:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;X distortion - using the left and right arrows will increase or reduce the
length of a torus, causing it to become oblong on the X axis.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Y  distortion - using the up and down arrows will increase or reduce the width
of the torus, causing it to become oblong on the Y axis.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Z\Up distortion</b>:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Z distortion - using the left and right arrows will increase or reduce the
height of a torus, causing it to become taller or shorter on the Z axis.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Up distortion - using the up and down arrows will actually 'stretch' and taper
the torus, causing it to become more of a hollow 'tube' on the Z axis.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ring\Seg edges</b>:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ring edges - using the left and right arrows will cause the edges of the 'rings'
of a torus to become angled or squared off, creating more of an overall 'box' shape.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seg edges - using the up and down arrows will cause the edges of the 'segments'
of a torus to become angled or squared off, giving it more of a 'hallway' shape.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both of these powerful functions can render some very unusual results and shapes
that add just 'gobs' of real creativity, experimentation and fun to this object.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Reset & the X buttons</b>:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reset button - this one 'defaults' button, as it is marked, will reset all of
the default values for this dialog box.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;X button - this will of course close the dialog box with its current settings.
Even though it may be closed, these settings are still active.

<b><u>As some general notes</u></b>:<br>
All of the input amounts can also be done manually and will take multipal decimal place input as well, except the
first set for 'Segments\Faces'.<br>
Also, there have been some built in safe gards such as not allowing some to go below zero or pass another that can
cause a torus to break up.<br>
Another safe guard that has been added is the removal of any unbound (floating) faces during the dragging process when very
abstract shapes are being created.<br>
So basicly, 'what you see is what you get'.
