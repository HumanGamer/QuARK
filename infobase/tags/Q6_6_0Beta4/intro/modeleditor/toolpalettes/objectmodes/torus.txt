<I><u>Quick torus maker</u></I>:  After you click this button, you can draw a torus in the editor with
the left mouse button and each torus will be turned into an actual model object.

Move the mouse forward to add more faces, backwards for fewer faces, right to make it larger and left to make
it smaller.<br>NOTE: Less than 3 faces will not draw anything.

This particular object maker has its own

because of the many different shapes that can be obtained when using a torus object.
