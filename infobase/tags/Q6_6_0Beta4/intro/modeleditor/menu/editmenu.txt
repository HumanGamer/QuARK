<i>Undo [something]</i>. This menuitem will be active, if you can undo a
previous action. The <i>something</i>, will be the action it will undo.

<i>Undo/Redo</i> will open up the Undo/Redo window, where you can undo or redo
more actions with one mouse-click.

<i>Cut</i>. You know; remove the selection and put it into the clipboard.

<i>Copy</i>. Just as easy; copy the selection into the clipboard.

<i>Paste</i>. Take whatever is in the clipboard, and if it is something QuArK
can use, it will paste it to where you point.

<i>Duplicate</i>. A copy <u>and</u> paste action, but without putting the
selection in the clipboard.

<i>Delete</i>. Deletes the selection. Notice that it won't put anything in the
clipboard.
