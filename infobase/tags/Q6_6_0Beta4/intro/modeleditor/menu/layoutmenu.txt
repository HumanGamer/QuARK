<i>Wireframe</i> will change all model-views to show the model as
wireframe-graphics. This is the fastest drawing-method of the model-views.

<i>Solid</i> will change all model-views to show the model as a solid object.
This means that you won't be able to 'see-through' the model once it's in
view.

<i>Textured</i> will change all model-views to show the model with it's
applied textures and alignment.

<i>3D view</i> will create a new free-floating 3D edit window.
You can actually edit the model in the 3D view
and manipulate its 'mesh' (frame shape). This view, and all the others,
can use the OpenGL standard 3D graphic library.

<i>Show whole level</i> will in wireframe-mode, draw all lines the model
consists of, even those that can't be seen simultaneously in all model-views.

<i>Gray out of view</i> will in wireframe-mode, draw grey lines of those parts
of the model, which can't be seen within the model-views.

<i>Hide out of view</i> will in wireframe-mode, only draw lines for those parts
of the model, which is within the model-views.
