title: Bones & Their Matrixes
author: cdunde

The under lying engine of the bones are their <a href="#bones3">Matrixes</a> which are primarily used in their rotation
movements but can also be used for their linier movements as well.

This is exactly why they are stored in the <a href="intro.modeleditor.importexport.html#bones2">editor.ModelComponentList</a>
when they are read in from an imported model file that has bones. Without these, the model could not be properly exported.
But simply having their matrixes is not enough, they also need to be <g>inverted</g> to give the opposite values that the importer brings in,
because that is what happens when they are used to import them, the bone handle's positions are changed around by the matrixes for the editor's uses.
So that needs to be reversed on export.

Unfortunately, I am not a Mathematician, but I was lucky enough to stumble across a page on
<a href="http://www.maths.surrey.ac.uk/explore/emmaspages/option1.html">Matrices and Determinants</a>.
After many hours of extreme hair pulling, I was able to decipher what it was trying to explain.
And that is why I made up the <g>Layman's Chart</g> on Inverse Matrix below, to help others to understand
how it works and how to use it.

There's not a lot to explain here, hopefully the colored steps will do the job much better.

Just one basic point. For a 3x3 matrix, each row has three values stored in it as a small list,
and those are in position 0, 1 and 2 of their list. Three of this lists make up the matrix.

It also has three columns, which starts from the left hand side, of all the values in that position
running from top to bottom.

One very important thing to remember in working to invert a matrix is that you do <b>not</b> want
to change to original values as you invert the matrix. You need to make a copy of it and change
the copy. Other wise this method will not work and you'll wind up with a mess on your hands.

To see this applied in <g>Python code</g> take a look at the <g>plugins\ie_md5_export.py</g> file's
<g>def inverse_matrix</g> function near the top. Then use the name of that function for a word search
to backtrack it in the file to see the preparation of <g>self.bones</g> for it to work with.

This function creates a new list of these inverted matrixes, one for each bone, called <g>self.bone_matrix_list</g>
and that list is called on later in the file for their use. So use that list name in another word search
to see how they are used to define ( <b><g>=</g></b> ) another variable and just keep following those names to the end results.

In the last step of the chart it shows <g>1/6.0</g> as though it is multiplying the matrix by that value.
I have no idea if it is or not, or what that is used for. I did <b>not</b> use it in the md5 export file,
but it works great without it.
