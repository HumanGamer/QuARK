Pressing this button, will open a dialog input box for the <a href="intro.mapeditor.toolpalettes.objectmodes.html">Object modes Toolbar</a> item currently in use.

Not all objects will use the same <a href="intro.mapeditor.toolpalettes.objectmodes.html#dialogboxes">dialog input box</a>. Which ever object button is active at the time this button is clicked, will produce that objects dialog input box.<br><a href="intro.mapeditor.toolpalettes.objectmodes.html#dialogboxes">These dialogs</a> will remain open until they are closed manually. They can also be moved around, resized and will save their settings, which are still active while closed, when QuArK is exited.

If a particular object has its own dialog then that objects name will appear in the title. Other wise the standard <a href="intro.mapeditor.toolpalettes.objectmodes.html#dialogboxes">Object Distortion Dialog</a> will be used for all other objects.<br>You can have one or more <ref> ./dialogboxes </ref>. open and active at a time. But they will only effect the objects that use them.
