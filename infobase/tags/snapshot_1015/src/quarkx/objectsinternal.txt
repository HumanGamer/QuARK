title: Internal QuArK objects
author: Armin Rigo

Internal Objects are all the objects that QuArK works with, stores in files, and displays in tree views. Each Internal object has a name, which usually contains an extension like files. The extension is called the type of the object, and the part of the name before the extension is the shortname. Internal File Objects are the Internal Objects that correspond directly to a file, e.g. BSP or QRK files. Such objects have the file extension as type, e.g. “ .bsp ” or “ .qrk ”. Non-File Objects are internals to a file, and cannot be stored into their own file. For example, polyhedrons and entities are Non-File. Such objects have a type that starts with “ : ” instead of “ . ”, e.g. “ :p ” for polyhedrons.

Besides this, all Internal Objects have a list of Specifics/Arg, much like Quake entities, as well as sub- items, as displayed in tree views.
