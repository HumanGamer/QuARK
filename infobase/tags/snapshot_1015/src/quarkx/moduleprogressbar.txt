title: The progressbar module
author: Armin Rigo
format: html

<p>You create a progress bar by calling quarkx.progressbar(txt,count), which returns a copy of the module described in the following table.</p>

<table border=1 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=4>

<tr><td class="doccode">
progress()
</td><td>
Makes the bar go one step forward. When you called this function count time, the bar is at 100%. If the user clicked on the “ cancel ” button, progress() will raise an exception quarkx.aborted.
</td></tr>

<tr><td class="doccode">
close()
</td><td>
Closes the progressbar module. This is very important! You should always use try...finally to make sure that close() is called.
</td></tr>

<tr><td class="doccode">
count()
</td><td>
Returns the value of count given to quarkx.progressbar.
</td></tr>

<tr><td class="doccode">
changecount(new)
</td><td>
Changes the value of count. Do this only if you really can’t compute the exact value at the beginning, because calling changecount can make the bar jump forward or backward!
</td></tr>

</table>
