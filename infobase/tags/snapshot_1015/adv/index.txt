title: Advanced customization
subdir: intro addons plugins quarkpy doc

This section discusses the features of QuArK that can be customized without modifying the source code. This mainly includes :

<p><strong>Add-Ons</strong> : lists describing new entity types, new textures, etc. This is what you need to have QuArK support new Mods of the game or new games altogether.

<p><strong>Plug-Ins</strong> : scripts programmed in Python that modify existing features or add new features to QuArK. They are mainly related to the map editor, which is itself programmed mostly in Python.

See section
<ref> maped
 for more information about how to use the map editor.
