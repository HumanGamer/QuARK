title: What is the history of QuArK?
author: Gryphon

QuArK was originally called QuakeMap, and was a map-only editor for Quake. QuakeMap broke with the "traditional" 3-view (xy,
xz, yz) interface and opted to go for a much simpler to understand interface that showed just a "side" and "top" view, with a
"compass" that rotated your level through 360 degrees, making the third "view" unnecessary. This opened up much of the screen
real estate, and by incorporating a small uncluttered toolbar on the left hand side, along with extensive right-click
functionality, this enabled new users to quickly and easily learn the interface enough to put their efforts into their
creations, and not into learning the editor and it's complicated arrays of views and tool buttons.

Armin has ceaslessly expanded his program, and progressed to the point where Quake"map" was no longer representative of the
scope of the program. The name was changed to Quake Army Knife (QuArK for short) which better signified it's "all-in-one"
abilities.

QuArK has expanded to integrate all of it's various editors and abilities into a single interface called the QuArK Explorer
that allows you to control any Quake related resource and to seamlessly integrate any and all of these items into a single
QuArK file with the extension ".QRK". Items can be added, removed, and changed at will, and this means that your past projects
can be included in your future projects, simply by "linking" to the .QRK file that contains them. All of your current items are
shown in the Explorer, and managing the items is a simple as clicking on an entry.

Complete conversions have been done using nothing but QuArK, and with Armin constantly improving and adding functionality, it
is fast proving to be the only tool needed to do anything you like with Quake and Hexen2.
