Depending on the value in the <ref> ./configuration </ref>, this button will
either inflate (make bigger), or deflate (make smaller) your selection by the
specified units.

If the inflate/deflate value is negative, the button will act as an
deflate-button, and positive values will make it act as an inflate-button.
