Pressing this button, will open up the movement configuration box, so you can
specify different values for the move-, enlarge-, shrink-, inflate/deflate- and
rotation-buttons.

<i>Move selection (x,y,z)</i>. Here you specify, the distance in units, the
<ref> ./move \ move-button </ref> should move the selection with. These values
can be both positive and negative. For instance; '+8 -16 0' will move the
selection +8 units in X-direction, -16 units in Y-direction and 0 units in
Z-direction, from the common center of the selection.

<i>Zoom factor</i>. This value specify by which factor to
<ref> ./enlargeshrink \ enlarge/shrink </ref> your selection. You can't specify
a value lower than '1', but you can specify floating point values like '1.75',
if you so dare.

<i>Inflate/Deflate by</i>. By which amount in units, the
<ref> ./inflatedeflate \ inflate/deflate-button </ref> should change your
selection. A negative value will deflate (make smaller) the selection with the
number of units specified, and a positive will inflate (make bigger) the
selection.

<i>Rotation angle</i>. The distance in degrees, the
<ref> ./rotate \ rotation-buttons </ref> should rotate your selection. Best
values are from 1 to 180, since specifying anything above 180 or negative you
could just use the other rotation-button.
