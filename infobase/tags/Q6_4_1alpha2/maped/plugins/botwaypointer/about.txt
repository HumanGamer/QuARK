title: About this bot edit addon

The addon was made for letting people make/edit waypoints for their bot without being confused, like when
you are waypointing a huge map with alot of different waypoints, like camping, sniper-waypoints etc.

Although, this is a very new project, and there are probably alot of work needed to be done before we are satisfied
with it. This version curently supports HPB-bot for Half-Life, but the final goal is to support multiple bots and games!

Remember to activate the addon before you use it!
