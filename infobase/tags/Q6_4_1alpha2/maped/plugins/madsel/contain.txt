title: Containing Groups

This is for manipulating group structure, and other stuff.  When
you click it, for a face, poly, group or entity (brush or point),
you get a submenu consisting of the groups etc. that contain
what you've clicked, on starting with the item itself at the
top and going down to worldspawn.  Then when the mouse is over
one of these, the chosen object, we'll say, you get a further
submenu with four options:

<UL>
<LI>Zoom - zooms the map view to the chosen object.

<LI>Select - selects that object, and also opens the tree view to the chosen object.

<LI>Restrict - this has the effect of `restricting' the map view
to the chosen object.  Things not inside that object are greyed out,
and can't be selected.  I find this convenient if for example
you want to work on the faces of a complex brush & don't want to
waste time clicking past the floor and other stuff of the room it's
in.  To reverse restriction of selection, use the Unrestrict
Selection item on the command and background menus (the one that
appears when the mouse isn't over anything selectable in the map),
or choose `worldspawn' from the Containing Objects submenu.

<LI>Mark - the chosen object is `marked' for further options in
the `Containing Groups' submenu.  Marking is similar in conception
to tagging, but the marked object is not drawn in any special way,
and the difference between the ideas is supposed to be that marking
is basically for reorganizing the tree structure rather than
positioning things in the map.
</UL>

One wart is that things aren't drawn right in the 3d window when
selection is restricted; I've got some delphi code that draws
only the stuff in the restriction correctly, but something else
is wrong with the source I have so that certain models and textures
aren't rendered correctly. Hopefully this will all be sorted out in Q5.11.
