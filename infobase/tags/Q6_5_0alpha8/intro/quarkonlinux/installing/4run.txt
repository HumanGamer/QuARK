title: Running QuArK
author: slightcrazed, Peter Brett

A note regarding running QuArk. Currently, it seems that the only way
to run QuArk and have it function correctly is to cd into the install
directory in a terminal and run the executables by hand.

Example: My Wine directories are located in my <tt>/home</tt> folder
under Wine.

To run QuArk:

<code>
cd /home/slight/Wine/C/QuArk\ 6.3/
wine QuArk.exe	
</code>

This is the case with many applications run under Wine.
