In this folder, you are able to setup which <g>file-extensions</g> should start
QuArK, when you double-click on a file in Windows File-Explorer.

Some of the file-extensions in this folder, QuArK might not be able to edit
yet, but you can always import them into your QuArK-project, and send it to an
<ref> ./externaleditors \ external editor </ref>.
