This panel will primarly contain all folders from new map items window, all
texture-folders from the texture browser, and a 'used textures in this
map'-folder.

Else its up to you, to drop other objects into this panel. Objects that you use
very often, would be a very good idea to put into this panel.

You can always remove objects from the panel, by dragging it to the trashcan.
