The map editor is the main part of QuArK. A map is a 3D world in which you can
play; the map editor lets you build your own 3D worlds, and you can use the
<g>FPS-game</g> to play in the worlds you built.

Basically, a map is made out of mathematical <g>polyhedrons</g> in 3D space.
Each of these polyhedron will be shown in the FPS-game as a wall, floor,
ceiling, furniture, or just anything with a fixed 3D shape. Monsters, weapons,
and other <g>entities</g> are not made out of polyhedrons, and you cannot use
the map editor to build their shape.
