title: Why doesn't QuArK have this really cool feature?
author: tiglari

Very likely some combination of laziness, stupidity, or pressure; or
perhaps nobody has asked for it.  So if you think it would be cool,
ask for it.  If nothing happens after six months or so, bring it up
again; QuArK was developed by a different person then the present
maintainers, and we are gradually learning how to do more thing with
it.
