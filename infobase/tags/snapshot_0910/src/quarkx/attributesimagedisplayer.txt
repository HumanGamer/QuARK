author: Armin Rigo

<p>Image Displayers are created by a panel’s newimagectrl() method. They are screen controls that display an image. Additionnal drawings can be painted over the image by Python code.</p>

<table border=1 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=4>

<tr><td class="doccode">
image
</td><td>
The image to display. It is an “ icon ” (although it might be of any size) as found in Image Lists.
</td></tr>

<tr><td class="doccode">
color
</td><td>
The color to fill the control with. Used if there is no image or if the image is smaller than the control.
</td></tr>

<tr><td class="doccode">
canvas()
</td><td>
Returns a Canvas object to draw a picture over the image or over the uniform background. See Canvas objects below.
</td></tr>

<tr><td class="doccode">
ondraw
</td><td>
Callback function. Called with the Image displayer itself as single argument whenever the image need to be repainted. If needed, this function should call canvas() and draw in it.

<tr><td class="doccode">
