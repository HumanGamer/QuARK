title: Copying
author: Tiglari / Armin

Sometimes an object is not loaded yet
when it needs to be saved on disk, typically when you make only a few
changes to a complex .qrk or .pak file. Then instead of loading the object
with all its sub-objects, which takes time and consumes memory, we make a
binary copy of the part of the original file into the destination file.
This is what Copying tries to do. It returns False if the object was
already loaded, meaning that direct copying is not possible. If
TransfertSource is True, the object's FNode is updated so that if it needs
to be loaded later in memory, it will be read from the copy instead. This
lets the original file be closed, which is necessary in case we are
overriting it (which is the case each time we do a normal 'Save').
