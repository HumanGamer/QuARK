<p><strong>Welcome to QuArK's Information Base.</strong> The goal of this database is to give a centralized place which stores all information about QuArK in a coherent way. With time, information found in other places should be moved here.

<p>Currently, the main source of information for mappers is Decker's <a href="http://www.planetquake.com/quark/help/index.html">Online documentation</a>. This database currently focuses on aspects of QuArK less directly interesting to mappers, from advanced mapping questions to plug-ins programming to in-depth information about the QuArK source code.
