You can move a brush, by moving your mouse to the black-handle in the center
(polyhedron handle), press and hold the mouse button, then move the brush to a
new position, and release the mouse button.

To size the brush, use the small blue-handles at the edges (<g>face</g>
handles).

To distort a corner, use the <g>vertex</g>. Notice that QuArK does not distort
just a single corner, but an <g>edge</g>. This is due to the internal storing of
faces, and in many cases ensure that your brushes are kept <g>convex</g>, which
they must be to be used in a Quake-engine game! True vertex-manipulation does
not exists in the map-editor.

Try to create some more brushes, and move them around, maybe even size them.
You can unselect the brush(es) by clicking in an empty space of the 2D-views,
and selecting them again by clicking within the brush. Notice that the
<ref> intro/mapeditor/dataforms/treeview </ref> will show you your new cubes,
where you also can select them.

Try also to delete and <ref> ../starting/undoredo \ undo/redo </ref> your
newly created brushes.
