Memproof<a> reveals a substantial assortment of resource and memory
leaks.  Unfortunately it's not entirely clear which ones are genuine
and which ones are Memproof misreports or Delphi bugs, but it is possible
that most of the really important ones have been dealt with.

So here are listed various things that still appear, organized by
when they show up, followed by some other items.
These leaks only include those reported when the
`specifics sharing' scheme is disabled, by compiling with the flag
`Noshare'.  Sorting the apparent specifics-sharing scheme leaks out
is a challenge we have not yet risen to (since specifics sharing is
arcane, involves assembler code, etc., the reports may well be spurious).
As of 6.5.0 Beta 2, a lot of these problems have been fixed, however
some might remain.

Developer Mode in QuArK also enables a command to track memory usage,
and compare current used message to that from the last call to it.
This can be used to tell if inordinate amounts of memory are being
consumed by map editing operations (of course the undo stack will get
bigger as editing procedes, etc.).
