title: Valve Mapversion 220
author: tiglari

The Valve Mapversion 220 map format used by WorldCraft 3.3
uses texture-scale representation that is quite close to that
used by the Q1/2 bsp.  After the texture name come 2
square-bracketted 4-tuples, then 0, and then 2 more numbers.
The first three members of the 4-tuples are basically the u
and v axes, except that they're normalized to have length 1,
while the last member is the offset.  Then the following 0
is empty cruft (originally indicated rotation), while the
last two numbers as uscale and vscale, but you divide the
u and v axes by them rather than multiply to get the .bsp
structure (so it's opposite to what a sensible person would
expect).  I.e.
<code>
 WC3.3: [u.x     u.y     u.z     u.o] [v.x v.y v.z v.o] 0 u.s v.s

 BSP:   [u.x/u.s u.y/u.s u.z/u.s u.o] [v.x/v.s, ...    ]
</code>
Reading is done by WC33Params in QkMap.pas (a sub-procedure
of ReadEntityList), Writing by Valve220MapParams in QkMapPoly.pas.
The writing code draws very heavily on Zoner's.
