<I><u>Quick dome maker</u></I>:  Clicking this button allows you to draw domes on the map with the <g>LMB</g> and each dome will be turned into an actual poly.

Move the mouse forward to add more faces, backwards for fewer faces, right to make it larger and left to make it smaller.<br>NOTE: Less than 3 faces will not draw anything.

The amount of its <a href="intro.mapeditor.toolpalettes.objectmodes.html#dialogboxes"><i>Object Distortion Dialog</i></a> will be the number of sections to create the top, dome, curved part.<br>
This can make angled sides or a more curved style dome by adding more sections.<br>
As the mouse is dragged more downward, the sides become more flared outwards.
