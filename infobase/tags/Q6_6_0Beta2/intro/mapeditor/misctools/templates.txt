title: Templates
author: cdunde

This is a very powerful tool that also has its own functions and setting in QuArK and because of this,
even though they are somewhat like <g>prefabs</g>, require its own section to help inform you of their
configuration and functionality features.

<i><b>What are templates </b></i>: Basically a template can be any QuArK .qkm map (work) file that can consist of a single
<g>poly</g>, <g>entity</g>, <a href="maped.curves.html">bezier</a>, <g>group</g> or anything else QuArK has to offer.
The .qkm map file can also consist of an entire map full of these kinds of items as well.

<i><b>How to setup templates </b></i>: First you must select a location folder to store the .qrk map files you wish to use
as templates. This is done by going to the <a href="intro.configuration.games.regaddons.html">Games Configuration</a>
section for each game that you want to have templates for and select a location folder for that game.
Until that is done you will not be able to use any templates. You can have as many .qrk map files in that folder as you wish.
Other things can also be done with the folder setting as well as the files them selves.


Once a folder location has be set then these are the steps that can take place:

<ul>
<li> A list of these .qkm map files is created by clicking on the
<a href="intro.mapeditor.menu.html#commandsmenu">Build templates list</a> function on the main
<a href="intro.mapeditor.menu.html">QuArK Commands menu</a>.

<li> This will automatically create a QuArK .qrk file
containing this list and place that file in the <g>addons folder</g> of the game you are currently mapping for.

<li> It will also name that .qrk file starting with the name of the game you are currently mapping for and
adding <g>Templates.qrk</g> to it.
<br>For example if you are in the <g>Quake 2</g> game mode you would find
the file <g>Quake 2Templates.qrk</g> file in the Quake_2 addons folder.

<li> This .qrk file must then be added, or <a href="intro.configuration.games.regaddons.html">registered</a>,
with QuArK in the <a href="intro.configuration.games.specificgames.html">Games Configuration</a>
section for <a href="intro.configuration.games.specificgames.html">Quake 2</a>, by clicking on the
<a href="intro.configuration.games.regaddons.html">Add-ons...</a> button.
</ul>

Once <a href="intro.configuration.games.regaddons.html">registered</a> you will see that list of template files on the
<a href="intro.mapeditor.misctools.html#newmapitem">New map items...</a> list.
Double clicking on a template will place it into the map you are currently editing.
If you completely close QuArK and restart it again, a small blue box icon will also be placed in the area
above the <g>Compass</g> that you can click on for quick access to your templates.

As you can see in the screen shot to the right, a template can become very detailed, and this is just a small example.

<i><b>How to use templates </b></i>:<br>
The power of using templates is that any changes that you make to the template.qkm file itself, are passed on to any
edited map file that you use that template in. You will need to reopen that edited map file in order for any changed
templates to update them selves, which they will do automatically.

Individual items in a template can not be changed in the edited map file. However, if a template is <g>Dissociated</g>
within the edited map file, by doing a <g>RMB</g> click over the template in the tree-view and selecting
<g>Dissociate Duplicator images</g> from the popup menu, every part of that template will be reconstructed as
individual items and can then be changed within that edited map file. Once a template is <g>Dissociated</g>
it can not be replaced back as a template.

If several templates are used within a <g>group folder</g> all of those templates can be <g>Dissociated</g> at the same
time by doing a <g>RMB</g> click over the <g>group folder</g>, selecting <g>Edit</g> then <g>Dissociate Duplicator images</g>
from its popup menu. You can also <g>Dissociated</g> individual templates within that <g>group folder</g> as described above.

<i><b>Template Specifics/Args </b></i>:<br>
A template only has three <g>Specifics</g> that can be set. These are:

<ul>
<li><b> origin</b> : This can be preset in the templates .qkm file and gives the location of
its <g>drag handle</g> when placed into a map you are editing. This setting will change as you
move the template around in the map or you can change its three values for x,y and z by hand.

<li><b> scale</b> : This will cause the template to become larger or smaller in size for its
three x,y and z values. For example you can enter values such as <g>2 2 2</g> or <g>1.75 3.54 2.65</g> something long those lines.
These values can only be changed by hand. When the template is <g>Dissociated</g> it will remain
that scaled size in your map.

<li><b> mangle</b> : This stands for <g>map angle</g> and is used for tilting and\or rotating
the template by using the little ball handle that is attached to its drag handle.
Just <g>LMB</g> click on that ball and drag the handle around to change this setting or again
you can do it by hand.
</ul>

<i><b>Making templates </b></i>:<br>
This is a fairly simple process but it does have a number of steps you need to go through which are:

<b> 1) </b> Start a <g>New map</g> in QuArK. You can save that new map, naming it anything you wish,
now or later as either a <g>Hand editable</g> or regular .<g>qkm</g> file. It can be saved any place
you wish, but to work, you must have it in the
<a href="intro.configuration.games.regaddons.html">Directory of Templates</a>
folder you selected for your template .qkm files to be located for that game.

<b> 2) </b> Now create any objects you wish to have in that template map using any of the items that
QuArK has to offer and that game can use such as <g>polys</g>, <g>entities</g>, <g>lights</g>,
<g>monsters</g>, <g>weapons</g>, <a href="maped.curves.html">beziers</a>, even other templates. You can
also do your special <g>flag</g> settings in this map as well as apply your textures and position them.

<b> 3) </b> This is where <g>organization</g> takes place. The map .qmk file you are working on actually
becomes a <g>Library</g> of templates if you wish. Either way you <b>MUST</b> have at least one
<g>Group folder</g> in which you place some or all of the items in that map. You can have several
<g>Group folders</g>, placing objects in different ones.

<b> 4) </b> Rename all <g>Group folders</g> to anything you wish. Clicking on a <g>Group folder</g> and
then going to its <a href="intro.mapeditor.dataforms.html#specsargsview">Specifics\Arg page</a>
you can enter a <g>Description</g> for that folder. Later,
you will see that <b>each folder</b> will become a <g>Template</g> and its <g>Description</g> will
appear in the <a href="intro.mapeditor.misctools.html#newmapitem">New map items...</a>
when you open this <g>Library</g> that is listed there.

<b> 5) </b> Not critical but a helpful thing is adding a <g>usercenter</g> for that group.
The <g>usercenter</g> is used as a point of rotation/scale operations of the group.
For example:
For a wall lantern - it's better that the <g>usercenter</g> is set at the <g>base</g> of a wall.<br>
For a floor lantern - at the <g>base</g> of the floor lantern and in its center on the floor.<br>
This makes it easyer to align the template object onto other real geometry.
This is similar for an added prefab. So adding a <g>usercenter</g> is highly recommended.

<b> 6) </b> Now save your file, click on your
<a href="intro.mapeditor.menu.html#commandsmenu">Commands menu</a> function
<a href="intro.mapeditor.menu.html#commandsmenu">Build templates list</a>, then
<a href="intro.configuration.games.regaddons.html">register that list</a> and you're done!

<a name="refreshtemplate"></a>
<i><b>Refresh Template </b></i>:<br>
If a template has changed, holding your cursor over that template in the map you are editing and doing
a <g>RMB</g> will bring up a menu with the <g>Refresh Template</g> function on it.
Clicking this function will update those changes to your current map where that
template is used. It may also update other templates in this same map if they have been changed also.
In addition it will be posted to the editor's
<a href="intro.mapeditor.menu.html#editmenu">Undo / Redo</a> list on the main
<a href="intro.mapeditor.menu.html#editmenu">Edit</a> menu.

Using the <g>Refresh Template</g> function is not always necessary, simply by moving something in the
<g>tree-view</g> or any object in one of the editor's views will also update any templates that have changed.

<i><b>Templates list rebuild & placement </b></i>:<br>
Just a few final things you should know. The only time you need to rebuild the
<a href="intro.mapeditor.menu.html#commandsmenu">Templates list</a>
would be if you added or removed a .qkm file from the templates folder location. Any changes made to
those files does not require a rebuilding of the list. Just make your changes to those files and save them.
Those changes will show up in all of the maps you have used those templates in the next time you open them.

As far as the placement of those .qkm template library files, that can even be in one single folder that
you can use for all of the games you map for. Which means you can pass those templates from one game to
the next. The only thing to remember about doing that is to be sure you do not use entities that will not
work in another game and that you add all of the textures you use to the
<a href="intro.texturebrowser.overview.html">Texture Browser</a> by
creating links to those textures or importing them into a
<a href="intro.texturebrowser.tutorials.html#texturelinks">CustomTextures.qrk</a> file and adding
that file to your addons for each game you want to use them in.
