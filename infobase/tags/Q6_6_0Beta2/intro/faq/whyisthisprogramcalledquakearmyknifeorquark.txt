title: Why is this program called Quake Army Knife or QuArK?
author: Gryphon, DanielPharos

QuArK is an acronym of sorts for QUake ARmy Knife. Its name is unrelated
to Quark, the Star Trek: Deep Space Nine Ferengi character, despite the
coincidence that the actor which played Quark (Armin Shimerman) shares
the same first name as the author of QuArK (Armin Rigo). For more
