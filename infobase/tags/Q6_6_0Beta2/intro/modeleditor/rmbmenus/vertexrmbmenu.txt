<i>Add Vertex Here </i>&nbsp;: This will add a single vertex to the currently selected model component
(and all of its animation frames) to make a new triangle. You need 3 new vertexes to make a triangle.
You can also make a new triangle by creating just one or two new vertexes and then use pre-existing
vertexes to complete the group of three. Then select each vertex using the RMB menu when your cursor is
over one of the vertexes you wish to use. Once all three have been 'picked' then RMB click on any open
area (area that the model is not in) of any view to get the
<a href="intro.modeleditor.rmbmenus.html#viewsrmbmenus">Editor Views RMB menus</a>, covered above,
and select 'Commands' then 'Add Triangle'. This can be done from the editor's main 'Commands' menu as well.

<i>Remove Vertex </i>&nbsp;: This will remove a vertex from the component and all of its animation frames.
WARNING, if the vertex is part of an existing triangle it will ALSO remove that triangle as well.
If this does happen and is an unwanted action, simply use the Undo function to reverse its removal.

<i>Pick Base Vertex\Change Base Vertex </i>&nbsp;: This item performs two functions:<br>
<g>1st</g> - This is used to pick, or remove, the <g>Base</g> vertex to align other vertexes to in one of
the editor's views.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
It also works in conjunction with the <g>Clear Pick list</g> below it.<br>
<g>2nd</g> - This is used to select another vertex as the <g>Base</g>
vertex to align other vertexes to in one of the editor's views.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
It also works in conjunction with the <g>Clear Pick list</g> below it.

<i>Pick Vertex </i>&nbsp;: This is used for picking 3 vertexes to create a triangle with. It also works in
conjunction with the <b>Clear Pick list</b> below. You need 3 vertexes to make a triangle. Once all 3 have
been 'picked' use the <b>Add Triangle</b> funciton on the
<a href="intro.modeleditor.rmbmenus.html#viewsrmbmenus">'Commands' sub-menu</a>, covered in detail above,
to create a the triangle.

<i>Clear Pick list </i>&nbsp;: This Clears the 'Pick Vertex' list of all vertexes and it becomes active
when one or more vertexes have been selected. The list can contain a maximum of three individual vertex
selections to do two things with, <b>Add Triangle</b> or <b>Delete Triangle</b> which are both commands on
the <a href="intro.modeleditor.rmbmenus.html#viewsrmbmenus">'Commands' sub-menu</a> covered in detail above.
Once a vertex has been 'picked' it will be displayed in all views as a larger and different color vertex
then those not 'picked'. If a vertex that has been 'picked' is picked a second time it will be removed from the
list and return to its normal appearance and another vertex can then be selected to take its place in the list.

<i>Align mesh vertex </i>&nbsp;: Once a set of vertexes have been <g>Picked</g> in one of the editor views
all of those vertexes will be moved to the <g>Base</g> (stationary) vertex (the first one selected) location
and aligned with that <g>Base</g> vertex. It also works in conjunction with the <g>Clear Pick list</g> above it.

<i>Align Vertex Options </i>&nbsp;: This menu gives different methods of aligning <g>Picked</g> vertexes to the
<g>Base</g> vertex.
<img border=1 align=right>vertexrmbmenu2.png</img><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<i><g>Align vertexes-method 1 </g></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;: This method will align, move, other selected vertexes
to the <g>Base</g> vertex position<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
of <g>each</g> tree-view selected <g>frame</g>.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<i><g>Align vertexes-method 2 </g></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;: This method will align, move, other selected vertexes
to the <g>Base</g> vertex position<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
of the <g>1st</g> tree-view selected <g>frame</g>.

<i>Merge Vertexes </i>&nbsp;: When two or more vertexes have been <g>Picked</g> in one of the editor views this function
becomes active allowing the <g>picked</g> vertexes be moved to the <g>Base</g> (stationary) vertex
(the first one selected) location and aligned with that <g>Base</g> vertex where they will then be merged into
the one 'Base' vertex. Two vertexes of the same face (triangle) can not be selected.
This function also works in conjunction with the 'Clear Pick list' above it.

<i>Force to grid </i>&nbsp;: This will cause any vertex to 'snap' to the nearest location on the editor's
grid for the view that the RMB click was made in.

<b><u>Special Notes:</u></b>

Once a new triangle(s) has been created it still needs to be <b>Skinned</b> on the
<a href="intro.modeleditor.model.html#mesh">Skin-view page</a> for proper viewing and completion of the
triangle(s). At first, the new triangle(s) may appear at a distant position of the Skin-view,
You can move the vertexes individually or do a <g>LMB</g> drag to select them, then using
the Linear Movement Handle (which will appear automatically) relocate them all at once on the Skin-view.
