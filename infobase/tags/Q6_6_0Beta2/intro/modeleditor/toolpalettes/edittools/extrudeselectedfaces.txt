Once selected, click this button to extrude in any of the editor's views,
but the best control is done in one of its <g>2D views</g>.
Each time a new drag is made a new set of faces, or vertexes, will be created from that starting
position to the position at the end of the drag with the new faces, or vertexes, selected.
Switching from view to view between drags will change the extruded drag direction.

<i><u><g>Face mode </i></u></g>:  Extrude Selected Faces
This function only works with selected <g>faces</g> in the Editor's views and the
<a href="intro.modeleditor.toolpalettes.display.html#linear">Linear Drag Handles</a> button <b>is</b> active.<br>
No <g>bulkheads</g> will be created.

<i><u><g>Vertex mode </i></u></g>:  Extrude outside edges
This function only works with selected <g>vertexes</g> in the Editor's views and the
<a href="intro.modeleditor.toolpalettes.display.html#linear">Linear Drag Handles</a> button <b>is not</b> active.<br>
It will perform the same function for all 'outside' edges (do not share two common vertexes)
that have been selected.
Two vertexes of the same triangle must be selected. If an improper vertex selection has been made it will
attempt to correct that selection or notify you if it can not.
