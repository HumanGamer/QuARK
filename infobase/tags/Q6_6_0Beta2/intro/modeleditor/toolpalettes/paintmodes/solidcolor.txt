This button allows Solid Color Painting of the <g>selected</g> model's component skin texture.
To paint the texture press and hold the <g>LMB</g> and <g>CMB</g> together and drag the mouse cursor
across the area to be painted. <g>Selected</g> meaning if there is more then one component of a model
it will only paint that components skin texture without effecting any other component's texture.

It not only works in conjunction with the
<a href="intro.modeleditor.toolpalettes.paintmodes.html#colorpicker">Color Picker</a> ,
described in more detail below, as one method of setting the color of the paint brush
but, with both active, it also effects the way different mouse buttons work.

One difference is the <g>LMB</g>, which normally, with a quick single click, will cause the
component the cursor is over in a view to be selected. Now it will select the color that the
cursor is over as the color setting for the <g>Solid Color Paint</g> brush.

It also works in conjunction with the
<a href="intro.modeleditor.toolpalettes.paintmodes.html#colorselector">Color Selector & Paint Settings</a>
which not only changes the color to paint with, but gives settings for the paint brush size and shape as well.
It does not effect the normal mouse button functions.

The ability to perform other editing functions will also remain in effect, such as dragging vertex handles,
selecting faces, zooming, panning, rotating and so on.
