If you have selected 'Software-only' in the 3D-viewer, then you can here change
how fast the software-render should be able to draw things in the 3D-window,
while standing still and while walking/moving around.

Low quality will cut the rendering resolution in half, and smoothed will smooth
out the roughness a little.
