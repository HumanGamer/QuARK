The RMB menu currently at least offers only two basic
shapes (arch/cap, bevel) in two orientations each, but
the 'duplicators' that implement these shapes have a
considerable number of specifics that implement variations.
You can see what these
<ref> intro/mapeditor/dataforms/specsargsview \ specifics </ref> do by making
an arch and experimenting.

If you uncheck the 'inverse' specific for example,
the arch will turn into a 'cap'.  In general, inverse shapes are concave,
non-inverse their convex counterparts.

Another important specific is 'subdiv'; it's value is a number,
2 upon creation, that determines the number of segments each
arch-half or bevel is divided into.  2 seems to be the minimum
to provide a half-decent appearance; more will of course
imply more polys.  Also there's 'inner'.  There are two ways
of approximating an arc with straight edges, the edges can
lie inside or outside the curve of the arc.  Outside is
the default, checking 'inner' switches to the inner method.

Another useful one is 'lower'.  This flips the arch upside-down,
so that the curved surface is a U that you can walk over.
Lower arches take their texture from their bottom ('down')
rather than their top ('up') faces.

Also there's 'onside' for caps and arches, and 'standup' for
bevels.  Note that these change the face that the texture comes
off, so for an 'onside' cap/arch, it will be the back face,
for a 'standup' bevel, the top.

All of these shapes are good candidates for being 'detail'
in games that support this; since the faces of the brushes
are all ultimately copies of faces in the guide brush,
specifics such as 'detail' (along with lightvalue, etc.)
will be copied from the appropriate face of the guide-brush.
