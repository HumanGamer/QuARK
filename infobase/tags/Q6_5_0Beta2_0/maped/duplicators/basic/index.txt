desc: basics more combinations linear increment

Standard duplicators make copies of the brushes of the
group they're in, arranged in patterns depending on which
duplicator is used and what its specifics are.  The most
often used ones put the copies in a row, although
there are also ones that arrange them in various kinds of
symmetrical patterns.
