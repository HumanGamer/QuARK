This button opens the <g>View Options Dialog</g> which has a number of different selections
and combinations that you can choose from for each of the editor and floating window views.
These are used as visual aids when working with a model.

<I><u>No drag handles</u></I>: This will <b>stop</b> the creation of any <g>vertex</g> drag handles
for the model's mesh which will speed up the redrawing of a view when a zoom, pan or rotation
in the view is being performed. However, <b>no</b> actual <g>vertex</g> work can be done in that view when
this option it active (checked).

<I><u>Draw no handles</u></I>: This will <b>allow</b> the creation of any <g>vertex</g> drag handles
for the model's mesh but it will not draw them in the view. This will also speed up the redrawing of
a view when a zoom, pan or rotation in the view is being performed. In addition, <g>vertex</g> work
<b>can</b> be done in that view when this option it active (checked).


<I><u>Fill in Mesh</u></I>: and<br>
<I><u>Fill in color</u></I>:<br>
These two items work in conjunction with
one another. When the <b>Fill in Mesh</b> item is checked it will give a solid color painting of the
selected model component mesh. When it is inactive (unchecked) only the lines of the mesh will be displayed
along with the models <b>skin texture</b> if the view is in <b>Texture</b> mode. The fill color can be
changed for each particular view by clicking on the <b>Fill in color</b> button, which will open a color
selection window, and the active color will be shown as the button color as well.

<b>Special Notes:</b><br>
If a model's component or animation frame is selected the mesh handles will be drawn in each active view
to draw them. If, after a zoom, pan or rotation has been made, the handles should not redraw simply
perform another very small zoom and they should reappear.

If the fill colors are not correct for the views, briefly hold down the <g>RMB</g> to reset all of the
active fill color views. Once a color has been selected, you should see all of the view colors updated.
