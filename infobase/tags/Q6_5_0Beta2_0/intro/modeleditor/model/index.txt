This section covers more of the technical part, in detail, of QuArK's Model Structure for programming
purposes and is very important to understand if you plan to do any code writing for the Model Editor.
Occasionally references will be made to the Model Editor's Python code located in the quarkpy and
plugins folders as well as areas in the <ref>src/quarkx</ref> section of these Infobase docs.
