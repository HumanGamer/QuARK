This is the Texture-flags window for a Quake II texture.  Other games may
support different texture flags (or none at all), so the window appearance may
be different.  These values are collected together and stored in the
"Contents", "Flags" and "Value" fields against each texture.

Very briefly, Brush says what the object looks liks, such as water, slime,
playerclip (player cannot see it), monsterclip (monster cannot see it), ladder
(player can climb up it).  Flowing indicates whether the texture moves, like
the surface of a river, and the direction in which it moves.  Face hold
properties of the face, such as whether it emits light of it's own, whether it
warps (the swirling effect on liquid surface), if it is slick (like an ice
rink) and so on.
