Then the game will need a <tt>:config</tt> and <tt>:form</tt> section in the file Defaults.qrk,
grouped with the <tt>:config</tt> and <tt>:form</tt> sections for the games already
supported.  People usually copy the ones for the game that is most similar
to the new one, and then change whatever needs to be changed.
You should pick a recognizable abbreviation and use it consistently,
e.g. SoF2 for Soldier of Fortune 2.

Also, the game needs to be added to the "<tt>QuakeCtx:form</tt>-group <tt>Game</tt>-sub-group <tt>Items</tt>-variable" list
(in Defaults.qrk).
