title: Saving files
author: Armin Rigo

Saving files is the exact inverse of loading them. The method Enregistrer must turn the Specific/Args and the subobjects structure back into a file. ("Enregistrer" = "To store".)

If the Charger method used LoadSibling, Enregistrer calls Info.WriteSibling (see QkMdl.pas).
