An <g>entity</g> is usually an object in the game, that the player can interact
with. There are two types of entities:

<ul>
<li><img width=16 height=16 align=absmiddle>image19b.png</img>&nbsp;
    Point-entities: Monsters, Respawn points, Light-sources, Controller-entities...
<li><img width=16 height=16 align=absmiddle>image19c.png</img>&nbsp;
    Brush-entities: Doors, Buttons, Trigger-areas, Non-solid walls...
</ul>

Brush-entities requires that at least one brush is attached to the entity, as
shown in the image.
