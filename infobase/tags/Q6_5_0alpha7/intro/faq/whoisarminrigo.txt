title: Who is Armin Rigo?
author: Gryphon, tiglari

QuArK was programmed by Armin Rigo while he was a mathematics student in Lausanne
Switzerland. Armin had been programming Quake related utilities since Quake's
release, and was the first one to release a program (DEACC) for de-compiling
Quake scripts in order to study their structure.  He later produced a map editor
called QuakeMap, which was then combined with DEACC and other tools to become
QuArK.  Armin has moved on from game-related programming and is now no longer
involved in QuArK or any other game-related activities.
