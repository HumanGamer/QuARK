<i>Reset 3D view </i>&nbsp;: If the model becomes 'lost', goes out of the 3D view, you can use this
function to reset the 3D view and bring the model back to its starting position when it was first opened
and based on the 'Rotation Method' you last chose to rotate the model by.

<u>Each view can be set to one of three rendering modes :</u>

<i>Wireframe </i>&nbsp;: The model mesh will be drawn as lines.
This is the fastest drawing-method of the model-views. 

<i>Solid </i>&nbsp;: Each model is drawn in a single, solid color or shades of that color.
This means that you won't be able to 'see-through' the model once it is in view.

<i>Textured </i>&nbsp;: The model is displayed with its full texture applied for the finished "skinned" look.

<i>Background image... </i>&nbsp;: When selected, this will open a dialog box where you can choose a .bmp image
file to place and display in the 2D view that the cursor was in when the RMB was clicked.
