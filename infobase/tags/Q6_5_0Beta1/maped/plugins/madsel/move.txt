title: Reorganize Tree
author: tiglari

These are the items that actually reorganize the tree-structure.
This appears as a submenu for entities, groups and polys, but
as a single item, `Lift to Marked Group', for faces.  This
item will cause the selected face to become a member whatever
group has been marked, so giving two-click face-sharing.
For the others, the Move in Tree menu contains three items:

<UL>
<LI>Insert marked into this
<LI>Insert marked over this
<LI>Insert this into marked
</UL>

Into and over refer to positions in the tree-view, and when the
commands are enabled, `marked' is selected be the name of whatever
is actually marked.
