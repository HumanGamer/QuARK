title: Duplicated keys in a multi_manager
author: Decker

<b>Question:</b><br>
How do I put in many equal keys (specifics) into a multi_manager, like this:
<code>
multi_manager
   "flashlight"         "1"
   "flashlight"         "6"
   "flashlight"         "13"
   "flashlight"         "19"
</code>

<b>Answer:</b><br>
The programmers at Valve have anticipated this, and implemented a feature, where
you can suffix the key (specific) with an <tt>#</tt> and then some unique text, so
the many equal keys (specifics) isn't the same.

Like this:
<code>
multi_manager
   "flashlight#1"       "1"
   "flashlight#2"       "6"
   "flashlight#third"   "13"
   "flashlight#last"    "19"
</code>
