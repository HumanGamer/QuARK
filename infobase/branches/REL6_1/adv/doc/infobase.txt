title: The Information Base
author: Armin Rigo

The Information Base is the source of information that you're just reading.
It is written as a set of organized text files whose format is described below.
The tool that translates these files and directories into a set of HTML files is the Python script "build.py".

The directories correspond to the classification in the final HTML files. Each directory must contain a file "index.txt" which gives the overall description of the category; it can also contain any number of other ".txt" files, which will be grouped into a single HTML. Each such text file correspond to a "question/answer" or item of discussion.
