title: Delay loading
author: Tiglari / Armin

If FFlags contains the bit "ofSurDisque" ("OnTheDisk") then
FNode points to data that give the file and the position of the object
inside the file. This is for the delay-loading mechanism. With this
mechanism, when an object is loaded, the FSpecifics and FSousElements
fields are filled, but the children in FSousElements are "empty" : they are
QObject which still sit on the disk. Their FNode fields give the position
for later reading. The method "Acces" must be called on them when they need
to be actually loaded. You must never try to read FSpecifics or
FSousElements before the object is actually loaded; if you're unsure call
"Acces" first.

In the map editor this is often not necessary because the complete subtree
of "worldspawn" is always loaded when the map editor opens.
