title: TypeInfo
author: Tiglari / Armin

This class method simply returns the 'extension' of the object. For files, it's the
usual extension with the dot; for non-file objects, it should begin with
':'. For example for TTreeMapEntity it is ':e'. This is a class function,
but it is virtual; it's a feature that I've only seen possible in Delphi,
not in C++. This lets the code below in QkObjects.pas build a list of all
the classes ("pointer to class" is something the C++ doesn't know about)
and when loading a object from a file or from inside a file we compare the
end of the name with all the TypeInfo's of the classes to know which class
should be the object we're about to build.
