title: Rounded Corners and Bevels
desc: makebevel

'Bevels' are basically half-cap/arches; the non-inverse ones
make rounded edges, while the inverse ones make things like
cornices and corners.  They come in both patch and
brush-vased versions, and work almost the same as caps and
arches, so look at those now if you haven't already.
