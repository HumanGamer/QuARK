title: Return to Castle Wolfenstein

One issue is that in the official tools release, many of the skins
for the misc_model models are missing; they can be collected from:
<a href=http://wolfenstein.gamesweb.com/dlman/download.php?id=146>
here</a>.

This info was found by Krekits at the rust Wolf forum, here's the
<a href=http://forums.gamedesign.net/viewtopic.php?p=23377#23377>
original message</a>.

An excerpt from the msg:

There is onbly a short german readme in it, because I made it 
just for 
myself and decided later to share it with others. 
Here's a short descrition: 
<UL>
<LI>download the zip file 
<LI>extract it with winzip 
<LI>please select to "Keep the folders" when you extract it, so the 
skinfiles will automatically extract into the right folder. (ex: 
mapobjects/furniture skinfiles to mapobjects/furniture folder) 
</UL>
You will be able to see about 90% of the models with the skin in 
your 
radiant. Some are missing, because they were not shipped with 
the game. 
Don't know why... 

I use an external program named "3D-Exploration" to preview and 
select  my models I want to use. It's faster then testing all in
the radiant.
