title: How to create a more realistic looking pipe-curve.
author: Decker

It becomes a bit more difficult now, since I have to use a template object, from where I lay my 'glue'.

First you must deside how many segments the curve should consists of. The more segments, the more round it will become.

I want to create a 180 degree bend, with 5 segments. Something like this image:

</center>

Once I've placed the end-pipes at the positions I want, I create a new tree-view group and put a <b>Linear Duplicator</b> in
it. Remember to put a value in the <i>count</i> specific, to the number of segments. The position of the Duplicator entity is
also important. It should of cause be in the center of rotation, and all handles (those small blue cubes that appear when you
select the Duplicator) must also be at the rotation center.

I take a copy of one of the pipes, and place it in the same tree-view group as the Duplicator. I then mark the Duplicator
entity again, go to the movement palette configuration window, where I specify an angle, by which I want to rotate the soon
duplicated pipes. In this case where I want 5 segments in an 180 degree angle, the calculation becomes <b>180 / 5 = 36</b>. So
I input 36 in the movement-tool configuration 'rotation angle'.

I then press the X-rotation button in the movement-toolbar, so the following appears:

Now its time to 'Dissociate Duplicator images', so right-click on the Duplicator entity, and choose that menu-option.

The Duplicator will disappear, but all duplicated images will now be true objects you can work on (and not just a duplicated
image).

Since two of the duplicated pipes, are along the same lines as the first ones created, I remove them:

I now need a template object, from which I can lay my glue-lines. This template object is just another 'Make Prism' cylinder,
but here I have to specify that the number of sides is <b>10</b>, the radius is <b>168</b> (in my case, properly not yours!),
and I want <b>pie-slices</b>.
<div class="sm">(See other note below, regarding unmarking 'Vertex on grid'.)</div>

I place the template cylinder in the center of rotation, like this:

<center>

</center>

Some of the pie-slices I have no use for, so I remove them, as they clutter the view.

I then select a side of a pie-slice and 'Tag face' it, by right-click on a face-handle of the selected brush:

<center>

</center>

Then I select the nearest duplicated pipe-segment, right-click on its face, and choose 'Glue to tagged':

</center>

Repeat the tag and glue, remember to remove the template pie-slices, and you will end up with this:

<table border=0 align=center>
  <tr>
    <td valign=top>
      <img>make_prism_complex_bend_8.png</img>
    </td>
    <td>&nbsp;=>&nbsp;</td>
    <td valign=top>
      <img>make_prism_complex_bend_9.png</img>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

You may need to do some finishing touches, in <b>grid 1</b> to align the segments perfectly:
<div class="sm">(Note from sgalbrai: If you unmark the 'Vertex on grid' when making the template object, the segments will end
up perfectly aligned.)</div>
