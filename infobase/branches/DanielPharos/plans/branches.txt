title: Tags & Branches
author: tiglari, etc.

The idea here is to record tags and branches entered into the
repository, with comments on their purpose and status.  I've
only done a few recent ones, mostly that I've been responsible for.

<UL>
<LI> <B>REL_61</B>: the branch for the Quark 6.1 release
<LI> <B>rel-63</B>: a short-lived branch for putting new stuff
  that wasn't supposed to go into 62. relevant contents merged
  into the main branch
<LI> <B>rel-63-exp</B>: ditto
<LI> <B>REL_62</B>: branch for the 6.2 release.  Hopefully closed off now!
<LI> <B>DanielPharos</B>: the branch where DanielPharos did his OpenGL work
<LI> <B>NuTex</B>: an experimental branch for testing schemes
  for dissociating texture positioning from face-positioning.
  <br>obsolete
<LI> <B>NuTex2</B>: an newer experimental branch for testing schemes
  for dissociating texture positioning from face-positioning.
  <br>only applies to QkMapPoly.pas
<LI> <B>Q3ABSPM</B> only for QkBsp.pas, QkBspHull.pas: Q3A Bsp
reading.  Now s/b closed, it's stuff is on the main branch.
<LI> <B>Leakhunt 1, 2</B> for runtime: useless bungling
<LI> <B>Leakhunt 3</B> for runtime: leak hunting modifications
<LI> <B>Leakhunt 3</B> for source: more bungling, needed
  stuff in main branch
<LI> <B>pre-635c1</B> a tag before adding a bunch of stuff just prior
to the intended rc1 (frozen selection, bilinear filtering in OBL)
<LI> <B>rel-63a</b> the 6.3 release branch, 'a' because of the ill-fated
63 branch above.
<LI> <B> rel-6-3-0</b> the tag for the actual release on the rel-63a branch
</B>
