title: QuArK 7, etc.
author: tiglari, DanielPharos

My current thought is that QuArK 7 should involve some major under-the-hood
revamping, in particular of the relation between QObjects and Python classes,
so that QObject is a 'new style class', subclassable in Python.  This would
be an important step towards actually getting somewhere with Quarkplusplus
(the project of translating QuArK to C++), or to much more extensive
Pythonification, using Psyco to achieve adequate performance.  Splitting the
Python codebase and the Delphi into two separate neat piles would also be
needed. Python should only handle the plug-ins, Delphi should do the hard
work, like vertex handling.

One of the major things that should be changed, is the way Args/Specifics
are stored. There ought to be a third list, which contain the type of data
stored. How else could one tell the difference between a number 3 stored
as a 2 byte variable, and number 3 stored as a 4 byte variable? This would
also allow easier distinction between numbers, string, color codes, images,
etc...

Further down the line, QuArK 8 should involve a rework of the GUI, which
is presently Python-scripting piled on top of heavily hacked Delphi 2
vintage VCL. Or even a complete port to C++.
