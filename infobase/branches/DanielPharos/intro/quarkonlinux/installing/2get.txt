title: Get QuArK

After following the above steps, you should have a
working Wine install with OpenGL compiled and functioning. There are
many versions of QuArk available, and most if not all will work with
Wine. The one issue is that versions are available with an installer
(.exe), or as a zip archive (.zip). The installer that comes with
QuArk 6.4 does not work with Wine. The zip archive are simply a zipped
up copy of the QuArk file tree, and these work perfectly. Some older
versions of QuArk will work as well, but may require a separate
download of Python.

If you need to download Python separately, ignore the link for
<tt>python1.5b.exe</tt> given on the QuArK home page.  The installer
does not work with Wine.  Instead you'll need the full Python 1.5.2
libraries from <a target=_blank href="http://www.python.org/">the
official Python website</a>.
