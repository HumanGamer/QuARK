<i>Duplicate Current Frame </i>&nbsp;: This copies a single frame that is currently selected and
adds that copy to that model component's animation frames list.
For multiple frame copies use the 'Duplicate' function on the 'Edit' menu.

<i>Add Triangle </i>&nbsp;: This adds a new triangle to the currently selected component. It works
in conjunction with the <b>Pick Vertex</b> function on the
<a href="intro.modeleditor.rmbmenus.html#vertexrmbmenu">Vertex RMB menu</a> described below. See that
function for more details.

<i>Reverse Direction </i>&nbsp;: Normally, in QuArK, creating a new triangles vertexes in a 'clockwise' direction
will produce a triangle that faces 'outwards'. But sometimes this does not work for adding new triangles to existing
ones. Activating this function (checking it) will reverse that direction causing the triangle to face the opposite way.
If needed after you have created the new triangle, simply check this item, click on the 'Delete Triangle' function below,
electing 'No' to remove the 3 vertexes, reselect those vertexes and recreate the new triangle.
It will then be facing the correct direction. The same thing can be done using the 'Undo' function on the 'Edit' or
<g>RMB</g> menus.

<i>Delete Triangle </i>&nbsp;: This removes a triangle from the currently selected component. It works
in conjunction with the <b>Pick Vertex</b> function on the
<a href="intro.modeleditor.rmbmenus.html#vertexrmbmenu">Vertex RMB menu</a> described below. See that
function for more details.

<i>Check Components </i>&nbsp;: This checks components for any errors in them that might exist.

<i>Auto Assemble </i>&nbsp;: Some models are made up of seperate model files for example .md3 files.
This function attempts to auto-load those related models model files and attach them using what is known
as tags to match them up correctly.

<i>X Y Z Axis locks </i>&nbsp;: All three of these items work in the same manor but are independent from one another.
They restrict any <g>vertex</g> movement in their related direction for all views and are interactive with their
corrisponding buttons on the
<a href="intro.modeleditor.toolpalettes.viewselection.html">View Selection tool-palette</a>.

All of these commands are dupelicated as a sub-menu of the
<a href="intro.modeleditor.rmbmenus.html#viewsrmbmenus">Editor Views RMB menus</a>.
