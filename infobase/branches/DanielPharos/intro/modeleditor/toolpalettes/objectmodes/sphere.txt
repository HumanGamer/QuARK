<I><u>Quick sphere maker</u></I>:  After you click this button, you can draw spheres in the editor with the left
mouse button and each sphere will be turned into an actual model object.

Move the mouse forward to add more faces, backwards for fewer faces, right to make it larger and left to make
it smaller.<br>NOTE: Less than 3 faces will not draw anything.<br>
Over 20 faces will 'freeze' QuArK but it will return.

Because the Sphere object is a far more complicated item to compute, creating it will take longer then the
other objects as the number of faces it is given increases. Although it can 'freeze' the program for a period
of time for processing, it will return the object and become active again.

Increasing the amount of its

will increase its height, making it more elongated.<br> Using a negative amount will make it wider or more oblong.
