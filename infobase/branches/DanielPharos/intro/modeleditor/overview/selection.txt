title: Selection & Navigation Methods
author: cdunde

<i><b><u>Selection Methods </u></b></i>: Different selection methods have been designed into the
QuArK Model Editor for the editor itself. Also see the
<a href="intro.modeleditor.skinview.html">Skin-view page</a> for its particular
<a href="intro.modeleditor.skinview.html#selection">Selection & Navigation Methods</a>.

<i><g>LMB</g> Click on Component</i> : A model can be made up of a single
<a href="intro.modeleditor.model.html#components">Component</a> (part) or a whole lot of components,
sometimes becoming very complicated. Such as a separate component for the head, upper torso, upper arm,
elbow, lower arm.....and so on. So to make these different components easy to select and find in the
<a href="intro.mapeditor.dataforms.html">editor's tree-view</a> all you need to do is make a quick
<g>LMB Click</g> on any component in one of the editors views and that component will become selected
as well as its main folder in the tree-view.

<i><g>LMB</g> Vertex Handle Drag</i> : This method is available when your cursor is directly over a model
components mesh <g>vertex</g> (point) <g>drag handle</g> and the cursor will change in appearance when it is.
Holding down your <g>LMB</g> will allow you to <g>drag</g> that particular vertex to a new location in the view,
changing the shape of the model mesh for that particular <g>animation frame</g>. A specific <g>frame</g>
must be selected for this function to work. If not, a warning message will appear instructing you do to so.
In which case you will need to click your <g>LMB</g> one time anywhere in the same view to release,
or free up, the mouse's action and continue on with your work or make that frame selection in the editor's <g>tree-view</g>.

<i><g>LMB</g> Rectangle Selector</i> : This method is available when the cursor is <b>not</b> over a <g>vertex</g>.
Holding down your <g>LMB</g> and moving your mouse will produce a <g>Red Rectangle</g> selector that you can
drag across the view. This selector will allow you to make a multiple selection of a model components mesh
vertex points at one time. These vertexes can then be passed on to the
<a href="intro.modeleditor.skinview.html">Skin-view</a> or will be done so
automatically if you have activated one of the options on that editor's view
<a href="intro.modeleditor.skinview.html">RMB menu</a> (which you can obtain by clicking your <g>RMB</g> in that view)
for <a href="intro.modeleditor.rmbmenus.html#viewsrmbmenus">Editor Vertex Options</a>. These options are also available on
the main <a href="intro.modeleditor.menu.html#optionsmenu">Options menu</a>. As the Model Editor is developed,
this selection method will be used to move whole sections of the model's mesh by use of its selected triangle <g>faces</g>.
To <g>de-select</g> any and all vertexes, simply do another small <g>Rectangle drag</g> in any unused area of any view.

<i><g>LMB</g> & <g>RMB</g> Face Selector</i> : The third method is a unique one in that by holding down
your <g>LMB</g> and <g>RMB</g> together you can do a number of things:

1) If your cursor is over a model's mesh <g>face</g> it will select that particular <g>face</g>, outlining it in the
<a href="intro.modeleditor.toolpalettes.viewselection.html#coloroptions">Editor views selected faces outline color</a>
that you can change by using the
<a href="intro.modeleditor.toolpalettes.viewselection.html#coloroptions">Color Options button</a>.

2) Continuing to hold your mouse buttons and dragging your cursor over the model's mesh will select additional
faces.

3) Dragging over a face that has already be selected will <g>de-select</g> that face.

4) And doing a <g>LMB</g> & <g>RMB</g> drag in any unused area of any view will <g>de-select</g> any and all faces.

Besides outlining the selected faces, as described above, it will also <g>fill in</g> those faces, for easier
identification, if you have activated, checked, the
<a href="intro.modeleditor.toolpalettes.viewselection.html#viewoptions">View Options 'Mesh in Frames'</a> item
for any particular view. This selection method also works in conjunction with a view's
<a href="intro.modeleditor.rmbmenus.html">RMB menu</a>
<a href="intro.modeleditor.rmbmenus.html#viewsrmbmenus">Editor Face Options</a>
and main <a href="intro.modeleditor.menu.html#optionsmenu">Options menu</a>.

<i><b><u>Navigation Methods </u></b></i>: The QuArK Model Editor navigates much like it does in the Map Editor,
except for one big difference for any of its <g>3D views</g> as covered in detail below.

<i>2D Views</i> : Using your <g>MMB</g> you can <g>Zoom</g> in and out for any of the 2D and 3D views.
Press and holding your <g>RMB</g> will allow you to <g>Scroll</g> or <g>Pan</g> in those same views.
All other combinations are used as described above in the
<a href="intro.modeleditor.overview.html#selection">Selection Methods</a> section.

<i>3D Views</i> : Besides what we just covered above, the 3D views have one more navigation item, the <g>RMB</g>.
When your cursor is <b>not</b> over a <g>vertex</g> <g>drag handle</g> you can use this to <g>Rotate</g>
the model with. This is also used in conjunction with the main
<a href="intro.modeleditor.menu.html#optionsmenu">Options menu</a> item
<a href="intro.modeleditor.menu.html#optionsmenu">3D Rotation Options</a> which
give you four selections to choose from, each one being distinct from the others as to how rotation will take
place and its particular point of rotation. Experimenting with each one will soon get you acquainted to their use.
