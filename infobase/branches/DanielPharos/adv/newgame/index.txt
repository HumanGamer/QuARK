Here is a quick overview of how to support a new game; if the game uses
pretty much the same technology as one that QuArK already supports, this might
be enough, otherwise you might actually have to learn something about how
QuArK works.

But first, before actually doing anything, post to the
<a href="http://www.dark-forge.com/forums/">QuArK forum</a>,
or if you for some reason can't do that, e-mail Decker, tiglari or cdunde to
say what you want to do, in case somebody is already doing it.
