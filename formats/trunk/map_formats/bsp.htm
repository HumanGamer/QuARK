<b>A simplified yet complete explanation of BSP trees and their uses</b></center>
<hr width="100%" size="2">
I've seen several people ask a lot of things about the technical aspects
of the BSP tree structure, the CSG process, etc.
<br>Well, I decided to write a simple document detailing how many of the
technical aspects work, in the approximate order of complexity.&nbsp; These
rules apply to almost any game using BSP trees for geometry, and I'll be
covering how many of those aspects work.
<br>
<hr width="100%" size="2"><b>Q:</b> What is "BSP" in the first place?
<br><b>A:</b> BSP is an acronym for Binary Space Partitioning, which is
an efficient way of doing many things in a 2D or 3D world, including location
approximation, sorted rendering, and collision detection.
<p>To understand what binary space partitioning is, break down the word
into its pieces: Partitioning, or separation, binary, or two, as in two-sided,
and space, or existantial area.&nbsp; Basically, binary space partitioning
means cutting up space into sides, and every part of the world is on a
side of some partition, or divider.
<p>Most game engines these days use a BSP tree, which is a simple two-child
tree structure.&nbsp; To understand what this means, one must first be
familiar with the tree structure in programming.&nbsp; Basically, a two-child
tree looks something like this
<br><img SRC="bsp_files/tree.gif" ALT="Two-child tree diagram" height=212 width=160>
<p>Now, that obviously looks nothing like the world you see when you play,
but that's how it appears to the engine.&nbsp; Basically, the head node
contains everything in the entire world, and each node in turn has children.&nbsp;
Some nodes have no children, which means they're called "leafs", just like
leafs on a tree have no branches.
<br>
<hr width="100%" size="2"><b>Q:</b> How does this have anything to do with
the 3D world?
<br><b>A:</b> Each node (and leaf) branching off from a node higher up
in the tree is separated by a plane, which is basically a flat invisible
sheet in the world.&nbsp; Which side a point is on the side of that plane
determines which way you search the tree when trying to find your location.
<p>To better explain it, I'll make some diagrams representing a 2D world,
using lines instead of planes.&nbsp; In these diagrams, white space represents
empty space, gray represents solid space, and red lines represent BSP partitions.
<p><img SRC="bsp_files/room.gif" NOSAVE BORDER=0 height=216 width=333>
<p>This is a simple, 4-sided room, with solid world outside.&nbsp; Now,
there are 5 different places you could be in the world given that diagram,
so those areas are the <b>leafs</b> in the tree diagram.&nbsp; Basically,
within each <b>leaf</b> , there are no lines left to separate your location.&nbsp;
However, a 4-sided room is kind of useless in the world of BSP, so let's
add something to make it useful: A block.&nbsp; And that brings us to our
next section:
<br>
<hr width="100%" size="2"><b>Q:</b> What's CSG mean and how is the BSP
tree useful for location finding?
<br><b>A:</b> CSG is an acronym for Constructive Solid Geometry.&nbsp;
To understand it, once again, it's best to dissect the term.&nbsp; Constructive,
meaning used to put together something more complex, solid, meaning an
obstruction (in this case), and geometry, which means a mathematically-defined
shape.&nbsp; Basically, constructive solid geometry is geometry used to
construct a larger solid piece of geomtry.&nbsp; There are also "CSG operations",
which are mathematical algorythms used on CSG pieces (commonly called <b>brushes</b>)
to cause brushes to interact with each other and the world.
<p>Important CSG operations include merging, subtracting, and cutting (a
form of subtraction used in the BSP tree generation process).
<p>In most editors now a days, a basic CSG unit is called a "brush", which
is used to describe a single convex solid.&nbsp; Remember, it has to be
convex.&nbsp; In other words, geometry with dents and such in it are not
allowed:
<br><img SRC="bsp_files/oknotok.gif" ALT="Good and Bad Brushes" NOSAVE BORDER=0 height=106 width=190>
<br>The reason for this is that the second brush isn't a convex solid.&nbsp;
In order for the engine to find out which leaf a point is in, that leaf
has to be completely enclosed, and for many reasons, CSG operations won't
work unless the same is true for the brushes.&nbsp; Take a look at the
diagram below.&nbsp; The X marks a location which is behind one of the
partitions, which means it could be considered outside of the brush, even
though it's actually inside.
<br><img SRC="bsp_files/pointoffplane.gif" ALT="Point off plane error" NOSAVE BORDER=0 height=162 width=351>
<p>So, let's see what happens when a simple wedge is added to the example
room:
<br><img SRC="bsp_files/roomwithwedge.gif" NOSAVE BORDER=0 height=216 width=333>
<p>Unfortunately, this can't be done as-is, because the empty space needs
to be sectioned off, divided only by partitions with nothing else inside
it.&nbsp; So, to do this, a CSG subtraction of the empty space is done,
generating partitions along the lines of the added brush:
<br><img SRC="bsp_files/roompostcsg.gif" NOSAVE BORDER=0 height=216 width=333>
<p>One thing many avid mappers may notice is that the solid space is actually
being "carved" just like solid brushes often can be in their favorite map
editor.&nbsp; Only in this, it's empty space being carved.&nbsp; You see,
in the engine, solid and empty space are treated equally, and every part
of the level has to be sectioned off regardless of content.
<br>
<hr WIDTH="100%"><b>Q:</b> Okay, so how does a BSP tree get generated from
this?
<br><b>A:</b> Basically, a BSP tree is created by adding each partition
to the tree one at a time.&nbsp; To reduce the number of cuts in the CSG
operation, axial partitions, as in lines that only go horizontally or vertically,
or in the 3D world, walls, floors, and other non-angled objects, are added
first.&nbsp; Each time a partition is added, one of the leafs is split
into a node, divided by the partition, eventually creating a finalized
tree!
<br><img SRC="bsp_files/csganim.gif" BORDER=0 height=243 width=675>
<p>It's important to realize that any leaf can be split into a node, not
just ones just created.&nbsp; If a wedge was added to Leaf 6, for example,
Leaf 6 would become a node and be split into more leafs.
<br>
<hr WIDTH="100%">
<br><b>Q:</b> How does the engine determine which leaf the player is in?
<br><b>A:</b> It means that the program starts at the head node, and then
goes down to one of the children, depending on which side of the partition
the player is in.&nbsp; That node becomes the current node, and then the
process is repeated, until the current node is a leaf, in which case the
engine knows where the player is!
<p>This process is called <b>recursing the BSP tree.</b>
<br>
<hr WIDTH="100%"><b>Q:</b> How are BSP trees used for collision detection?
<br><b>A:</b> Well, the basic type of collision detection is line collision.&nbsp;
Line collision just means a line is traced through the world until it hits
something, or reaches its end point.
<p>So how is the BSP tree used for this?&nbsp; Basically, by recursively
checking leafs one-by-one starting from the start point and moving to the
end.&nbsp; If one of the solid leafs has the line in it, then it's a hit.&nbsp;
If not, it's a miss.
<p>Let's take a look at the picture below:
<br><img SRC="bsp_files/trace.gif" NOSAVE BORDER=0 height=225 width=333>
<br>In this picture, a line is being traced from a point in leaf 5 to leaf
7, passing through leafs 8 and 6.
<p>So here's the method for determining which leafs the <u>trace line</u>
is passing through and in which order:
<p>1. <b>Start:</b> Make the head node the current node.
<p>2. <b>Side check:</b> If both the start and end of the <u>trace line</u>
are on the same side of the current node's partition, then it means it
doesn't cross over the partition, so no collision with any part of one
side could be possible.&nbsp; The only possible collisions are ones that
could occur on the side both are on, so mark the current node as "MISS",
make the child that both the start and end are on the current node, and
start step 2 over.
<p>If the start and end are on different sides of the partition, then it
means it crossed a node partition, so it might have collided with something.&nbsp;
This needs to be checked, so move to step 3.
<p>3. <b>Split check:</b> Step 3 is only reached if the <u>trace line</u>
is split by a node partition.&nbsp; Since we're only interested in the
first solid object (or leaf) the trace hits, the side the <u>start point</u>
is on should be checked first.&nbsp; So, go down the tree on the side the
<u>start
point</u> is on, and do step 4.&nbsp; If that side's clear, then go down
the side of the tree that the <u>end point</u> is on, and do step 4 there.&nbsp;
If both sides checked out on step 4 and neither hit anything, then the
trace didn't hit anything in the current node.&nbsp; Mark it off as "MISS"
and go back up the tree from the current node.&nbsp; If you can't go up
the tree any further, then <u>the trace is done</u>: It's either a hit
or miss.
<p>4. <b>Recursion or contents check:</b> Now, a single side of a partition
is being checked to see if the line hits there.
<p>If the side being checked is a leaf, then it means one side of the split
check is done: If the leaf is empty, then the trace didn't hit on the side
of the partition currently being checked, in which case mark the leaf as
"MISS", go back up the tree, and back to step 3.&nbsp; If the leaf is solid,
it hit, so mark the leaf as a "HIT", and mark the node above as a "HIT"
too, then go back up the tree.
<p>If the node being checked is not a leaf, then it has to be checked the
same way the first one (the head node) was.&nbsp; So, make the node being
checked the current node, and go to step 2.
<br>&nbsp;
<p>For anyone who's not a programmer, this may be a bit confusing.&nbsp;
For anyone who is, here's a pseudo-program for determining it:
<p><tt>checknode (currentnode)</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; if(currentnode is a leaf)</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; if(currentnode contents
are solid)</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
return HIT</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; else</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
return MISS</tt>
<p><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; if(side start is on = side end is on)</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; return checknode (child
of currentnode both sides are on)</tt>
<p><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; result1 = checknode (child of currentnode start
is on)</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; result2 = checknode (child of currentnode end
is on)</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; if(result1 does not equal result2)</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; nodehit = currentnode</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; if(result1 = HIT or result2 = HIT)</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; return HIT</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; else</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; return MISS</tt>
<br>
<hr WIDTH="100%"><b>Q:</b> How do I determine which partition the line
hit, since its angle can be used for stuff like deflections?
<br><b>A:</b> Basically, the highest node up on the tree where one side's
got at least one hit and the other are all misses is the one whose partition
the hit is on!
<hr WIDTH="100%"><b>Q:</b> How are BSP trees used for sorted rendering?
<br><b>A:</b> Since only leafs should have parts of them drawn, you can
always find the most distant leafs from the player by recursing the tree
and instead of picking the side the player is on, pick the side they're
NOT on.&nbsp; This won't give you the leaf with the most space between
them, but it will give you the one with the most leafs between it and the
player!&nbsp; After a leaf has been rendered, just go back up the tree
one step, go down the other child, and start over, until the entire tree
has been rendered!
<br>
<hr WIDTH="100%"><b>Q:</b> What are clipping hulls?
<br><b>A:</b> I already showed how BSP trees are useful for line traces,
but those are only useful for simulating tiny objects like bullets.&nbsp;
For larger objects, there are many ways to do collision, one of the first
being using clipping hulls.
<p>Basically, the idea behind a clipping hull is to make a collision check
for a large object be done the same as a small object by creating a separate
BSP tree with the walls caved in.&nbsp; In brush-based environments, this
is easily achieved by just pushing the partitions of every brush outward,
then rebuilding the BSP, then just tracing the center of the object through
the new "hull".
<br><img SRC="bsp_files/clippinghull.gif" NOSAVE BORDER=0 height=190 width=500>
<p>You may notice a problem with this though: Even though the walls have
all been moved out the same distance, the player can no longer get past
the block if he goes to the top of the map.&nbsp; This brings us to the
next question:
<br>
<hr WIDTH="100%">
<br><b>Q:</b> What are axial planes?
<br><b>A:</b> Axial planes are partitions added to prevent blockages like
the one shown above from occuring.
<p>To make the problem more obvious, take this example:
<br><img SRC="bsp_files/hullproblem.gif" NOSAVE BORDER=0 height=162 width=459>
<p>As you can see, the gap between the walls and the wedge are about the
same, which means there should be a gap on both the top and bottom of the
clipping hull, except there isn't.&nbsp; Even though the walls have been
pushed out the same distance, the top edge is more acute, which makes it
push out farther.&nbsp; There are several ways to solve this, but the easiest
is to add axial planes, which in the 2D world go only horizontal and vertical,
and in the 3D world are non-angled planes like walls and ceilings.
<p>Here's what happens when axial planes are added to the brush:
<br><img SRC="bsp_files/hullfixed.gif" NOSAVE BORDER=0 height=162 width=459>
<p>As you can see, there is now a gap at both the top and bottom, so the
player could safely travel across both sides of the wedge.
<br>
<hr WIDTH="100%"><b>Q:</b> How is visibility determined in Quake-based engines?
<br><b>A:</b> Even though it takes a long time, the way visibility is determined
is actually pretty simple.
<p>Take this semi-complex BSP below:
<br><img SRC="bsp_files/portals.gif" NOSAVE BORDER=0 height=261 width=450>
<p>One of the things done during the BSP process in all Quake-based engines
is portalization.&nbsp; During portalization, every separation of every
leaf is converted into a portal.&nbsp; Ones that are opaque, such as wall
surfaces and water in some engines, are considered opaque portals.&nbsp;
Others are just used to determine visibility from the boundary areas of
a leaf.
<p>The way Quake's visibility processing works is by trying to create a
"separating plane" for each pair of portals, which is basically a sheet
or line that would put two portals on one side, and a third portal on the
other.&nbsp; If that can be done, then the portal left standing alone is
considered not in the way.&nbsp; If it happens, however, then that portal
is considered in the way, which means the two portals can't see each other.
<p>Here's approximately what would happen if the red portal was VIS'ed
against the green portal:
<br><img SRC="bsp_files/redvsgreen.gif" NOSAVE BORDER=0 height=261 width=450>
<p>As you can see from the magenta lines, there is no line that can be
drawn separating the blue portal from the green one, so the blue portal
is considered in the way.
<p>When the orange portal is put against the red portal, however, it's
different:
<br><img SRC="bsp_files/redvsorange.gif" NOSAVE BORDER=0 height=261 width=450>
<p>The magenta line shown completely clips away the blue portal, while
leaving the red and orange portals on the other side.&nbsp; This means
that the blue portal is not in the way, and if no portals are in the way,
then the red and orange portals can see each other.
<br>
<hr WIDTH="100%"><b>Q:</b> What are detail brushes?
<br><b>A:</b> Detail brushes are something introduced in Quake 2 and carried
over to Quake 3, and seen in many other engines.
<p>Detail brushes essentially aren't included in the portal list when it's
exported by the BSP utility, which means there's no way they can get in
the way during the visibility process.&nbsp; However, in order for that
to be truly effective, a "cluster" visibility system is needed.&nbsp; In
a cluster system, instead of the visibility data telling the engine which
leafs can see each other, it tells the engine which sets of leafs can see
each other.&nbsp; Those sets are determined essentially by creating one
BSP tree for the non-detail brushes, converting the leaf numbers to cluster
numbers, CSG'ing in the detail brushes, and then determining which leafs
the detail brushes occupy.&nbsp; Detail brushes don't cut portals either,
and since portals are used to generate faces, they don't cut world polygons
either.
