(*DanielPharos: This workaround is needed on non-English systems, and under Wine.
Delphi is trying to be smart, and we've made a terrible design choice. Storing the
float-ness of a Specific in the high-bit of the first character of its name is
just silly. Delphi now supports multi-byte characters and such, and in certain cases
it ignores the weird high-bit of our first character, causing the code to think that
the Specific in question isn't a float. Hilarity ensues.

The function here is an almost drop-in replacement for Delphi's TString.IndexOfName().
It does an extra check to make sure the name of the Specific found is binary identical
to what's asked for.

It's ugly, it's nasty, but it works. And without overhauling the entire way the Specific's
type is stored (with all the file loading/saving issues *that* brings),
I don't see another option.
