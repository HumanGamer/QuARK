AddTo3DScene:

AddTo3DScene is the method of map objects whereby the map structure
builds the 3d scene.  The real work is done by methods such as
TFace.AddTo3DScene in prog/QkMapPoly.pas [tig: what is the correct name for
a subclass's implementation of a virtual method?]; we see that
the workhorse line is:

        CurrentMapView.Scene.AddPolyFace(P);

CurrentMapView is a global variable of type TPyMapView defined by
this line of python/PyMapView.pas:

 CurrentMapView : TPyMapView = TPyMapView(-1);

A TPyMapView is a subclass of TScrollBox, I presume the -1 is setting
its owner to nothing [tig: check this].  For some reason, Scene is a property
whose read method is FScene, whose value is a TSceneObject.

TSceneObject:

TSceneObject defined in 3dfx/EdSceneObject.pas, with subclasses:

  3dfx\Ed3DFX.pas(123): T3DFXSceneObject = class(TSceneObject)
  3dfx\EdOpenGL.pas(107): TGLSceneBase = class(TSceneObject)
  3dfx\EdDirect3D.pas(60): TDirect3DSceneObject = class(TSceneObject)

The first is the class for the software and 3dfx 3d textured
views, the second of the OGL one, and the last is the start of
an unfinished projet to produce a 3dfx view; the appropriate
constructors are called by python/PyMapView:TPyMapView.NeedScene.
