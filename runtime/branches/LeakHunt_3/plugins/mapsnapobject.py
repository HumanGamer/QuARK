# WTF ---
#
# First the function that does the real work is defined, then the interface
# (a popup menu of parents with a Live Button Dialog) is set up.
#

#
# --  The Function that Does the Real Work
#
# Returns newface, newobj, rotated and shifted in accordance with the following
#  rather complex scheme.  The idea behind all of this is so that if an object has
#  to be rotated to make the selected plane parallel to the tagged one, this
#  rotation will preserve vertical orientation to the greatest extent possible,
#  that is the object won't tilt unnecessarily in intuitively annoying ways.
#
# Or so I hope.  This is pretty complicated :)
#
# The idea is that the object is swivelled around the Z axis and the tilted around
#  a horizontal axis (both thru its center) so that the selected face is paralell
#  to the tagged one, then the object is moved so that the selected face is the
#  specified distance from the tagged one (along the latter's normal).
#
# The rotations are determined as follows:
#
#   if both planes are horizontal (parallel to the xy plane), no rotations are performed
#
#   if one of the planes is horizontal, no swivelling is performed, but the
#     object is tilted around an axis paralell to a horizontal axis lying in
#     the non-horizontal plane, so that the two planes become parallel.
#
#   otherwise, horizontal axes are found in both planes (the bestaxes function).
#     then the object is swivelled so that these axes are parallel, and then the
#     object is tilted, around the now-swivelled horizontal axis in the selected
#     face, so that the two planes are parallel.
#
# Well actually none of these rotations are actually performed yet, rather a rotation
#     matrix has been assembled and is finally applied to the object.
#
# OK, now, finally, the object is translated along the now identically opposite noramls
#     of the two planes to be the specified distance/
