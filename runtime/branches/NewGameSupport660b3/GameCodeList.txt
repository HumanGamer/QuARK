Note: Some of the above Authors and dates may not be correct
due to full documentation was not available for older,
original versions.

Additional Notes:
================

When setting up for new game support please place the (game name):config and 
Game(game name):form sections, in the Default.qrk file, in alphabetical order 
so they will show up on the Games menu and config sections that way. This 
allows for easer and more consistency in location of these sections.

Also, be sure to update your copy before making any changes to ensure that 
a file(s) you have been working on have not been changed during your work. I 
speak from my own bumbling experiences!  <|8-\
