# ----------- REVISION HISTORY ------------
#
#
# $Log$
# Revision 1.5  2005/10/15 00:49:51  cdunde
# To reinstate headers and history
#
# Revision 1.2  2003/03/24 05:09:51  cdunde
# To upload the "new and improved" version of the layout. The layout
# itself seems to work fine, but somewhere in the python code, the
# auto-centering code might need some work. The views should center on
# the center of the view being moved, but that's not the case.

# Revision 1.1  2003/03/24 05:02:48  cdunde
# To add new 3 view - 2D layout
