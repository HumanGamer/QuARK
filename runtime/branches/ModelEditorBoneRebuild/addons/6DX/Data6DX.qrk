Be warned; if you let the player look inside a brush this way then we will look out the other faces too, since due to speed inner sides are not drawn. This flag is best for making fully invisible brushes that still can block players or for speeding up rendering by hiding brush faces that cannot be shown anyway, such as the bottom face of floor brushes for floor the camera cannot get under. Also; if you are having problems with z-fighting (i.e. shimmering flickering on surfaces) then setting this flag for one of them will prevent this."
