"""Version 2 of QuArK tagging support, moved to the quarkpy module as
it isn't just used by plugins any more.

Now dictionary-based, supporting any number of categories.

This is to deal with the problem of plugins being able to stomp all over
each others' tags, potentially causing problems.

This also solves the problem of how to tag many different types of object.
