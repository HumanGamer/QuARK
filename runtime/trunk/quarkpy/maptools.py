It helps you align polyhedrons and entities. You should always keep it active; otherwise, you could create slightly misaligned polyhedrons with small gaps between them, which is very bad for the game.\n\nThis 'grid' button has two parts : you can click either on the icon and get a menu that lets you select the grid size you like, or you can click on the text itself, which toggles the grid on/off without hiding it. As noted above, be careful when the grid is off.", ico_maped, 7, infobaselink="intro.mapeditor.toolpalettes.display.html#grid")

'Linear mapping' means any transformation like rotation, enlarging/shrinking, symmetry, or a combination of them all. When you use the rotate, enlarge, shrink, and symmetry buttons of the movement tool palette, you actually apply a linear mapping on the selected objects. This is only interesting to know for a special kind of Duplicators, the one that can apply linear mappings. It means that this kind of Duplicator can create images with any of the previous movement commands applied, for example to create spiral stairs.", ico_maped, 19, infobaselink="intro.mapeditor.toolpalettes.display.html#linear")
