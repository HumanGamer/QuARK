# A `Live Edit' dialog.  Note the action buttons, which
#   use a rather convoluted technique to produce their
#   effects (when a button is bushed,
#   quarkpy.qmacro.MACRO_zapview is executed with an index
#   saying which, this calls the appropriate function of the
#   dialog, which was attached to the editor when executed).
#
# A ListBox would be better than a ComboBox for data entry,
#   but FormCFG.pas doesn't at the moment support ListBoxes.
#   In principle, this could be fixed.
