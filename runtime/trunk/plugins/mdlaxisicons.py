# This attaches the item to the options menu; it's best for new
#  facilities to redefine menus etc in the quarkpy modules rather
#  than modify the files themselves because then if people don't
#  like the effects of your plugin they can remove all of them by
#  deleting one file.  The toggle-item itself works fine.
# The prolixity of `quarkpy.mapoptions' could be reduced by using
#  `import X from mapoptions' statements (without ""'s & #)as follows:
#""from quarkpy.mapoptions import *"" and
#""items.append(toggleitem("&Axis XYZ letter indicator in view windows",
#"AxisXYZ", (1,1),
#      hint="|Display the X Y or Z indicator letter per view to associate #the rotation menu buttons. These are for reference only and are not #selectable with the mouse."))""

# But I don't think that would be worthwhile, 
#  so we'll just use the long version below insted:
#


XYZitem = quarkpy.mdloptions.toggleitem("&Axis XYZ letter indicator in view windows", "AxisXYZ", (1,1),

# This part is a magical incantation.
# First the normal arguments for
#  finishdrawing, then the oldfinish=... stuff,
#  which has the effect of storing the current
#  finishdrawing method inside this function as
#  the value of the oldfinish variable.
# These def statements are executed as the plugins are being
#  loaded, but not reexecuted in later operations
#  of the map editor, only the functions they define are.

#Added a model axis indicator with direction letters for X, Y and Z with color selection ability.
#Added model mesh face selection using RMB and LMB together along with various options
#for selected face outlining, color selections and face color filltris but this will not fill the triangles
#correctly until needed corrections are made to either the QkComponent.pas or the PyMath.pas
#file (for the TCoordinates.Polyline95f procedure).

#
#Revision 1.12  2007/06/07 04:23:21  cdunde

#Revision 1.11  2007/05/17 23:56:54  cdunde
#Fixed model mesh drag guide lines not always displaying during a drag.
#Fixed gridscale to display in all 2D view(s) during pan (scroll) or drag.
#General code proper rearrangement and cleanup.
#
#Revision 1.10  2007/05/16 23:28:22  cdunde

#
#Revision 1.5  2007/01/30 06:37:37  cdunde
#To get the Skin-view to scroll without having to redraw all the handles in every view.
#Increases response time and drawing speed.
#
#Revision 1.4  2006/11/30 01:17:48  cdunde
#To fix for filtering purposes, we do NOT want to use capital letters for cvs.
#
