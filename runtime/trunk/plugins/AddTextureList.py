"""   QuArK  -  Quake Army Knife

 AddTextureList.py - Makes a games .qrk list of Textures by folder to use as a QuArK addon game file.
            - cdunde Feb. 25, 2008
            - This file is used by the QuArK ConvertionTool on the QuArK Explorer main Files menu.
            - The completed file will be created in the game's folder in QuArK's main folder.
            - The game's "textures" folder (with its sub-folders) must be extracted.
            - This code will process files in the main "textures" folder and all sub-folders on down.
