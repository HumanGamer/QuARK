"""   QuArK  -  Quake Army Knife

AddShaderList.py - Makes the GameShaders.qrk list of Shaders by folder to use as a QuArK addon game file.
            - cdunde March 31, 2008
            - This file is used by the QuArK ConvertionTool on the QuArK Explorer main Files menu.
            - The completed file will be created in the game's folder in QuArK's main folder.
            - The game's "shaders", "scripts" or "materials" folder (with its sub-folders) must be extracted.
            - This code will process files in the main "shaders" folder and all sub-folders on down.
