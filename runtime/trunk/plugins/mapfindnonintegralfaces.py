"""   QuArK  -  Quake Army Knife

Finds faces that don't have three integral threepoints, or vertices that
can be used as threepoints, and fixes them.  A preliminary of something that
might go into QuArK 6.3e if it seems stable and useful enough, in spite
of the supposed feature-freeze for Q6.3.  Maps created with 6.2 containing
dragged around textures are likely to provide work for this plugin.

Puts Find Non-integral Faces commands on search menu; this produces a multiselection
 of such faces

If a group has specific 'nonintegral' (value 1), then any non-integral faces it
  contains will be ignored (maybe wanted for detail brushes, exotic decorations
  or something).

Puts Integralize Faces command on commands menu; this forces very close threepoints
  to integer, or uses integral vertexes as threepoints if possible.
