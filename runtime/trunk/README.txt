1. What is QuArK?
-----------------

QuArK is the Quake Army Knife, a multi-purpose tool for games based on
or similar to the Quake engine by id Software.  QuArK has the ability
to directly edit maps, and to a limited extent, models, and can
import, export and convert sounds, textures and various other game
assets. It is also able to modify .pak and .pk3 files, as well as
importing compiled BSP's in order to study the entities as well as
add/change/delete entities from these files.

QuArK is completely different from the desktop publishing program
Quark.

You can find out more about QuArK from the official website at
http://www.planetquake.com/quark/

2. Where can I get QuArK?
-------------------------

QuArK is available as a free download.  Every couple of weeks, we do a
development snapshot, and these are available from
http://quark.sf.net/ as a .zip file.  If you want the Windows
executable, you'll be looking for a file such as
`quark-win32-<date>.zip`.

Occasionally, we do a release, which comes as an executable
installation program and marks a non-trivial increment in
functionality or stability.  Once again, you'll probably be looking
for a file such as `quark-win32-<version>.exe`.  These releases are
always noted on the front page of the QuArK website.

Source archives are also available, or you could use anonymous cvs to
checkout the sources from the SourceForge cvs repository (our project
name is `quark`).

3. How do I install QuArK?
--------------------------

If you downloaded a release with an installation program, you need to
run the installer and follow the on-screen instructions.

If you downloaded a snapshot .zip archive, just extract the files to a
directory somewhere on your hard disk. 

If you downloaded the source code, please see the relevant Infobase
pages for instructions for building QuArK.

4. How do I get help?
---------------------

Help on using and developing QuArK is available using the Help menu
(the one with a question mark), which will take you to the QuArK
Infobase (a centralized repository for all QuArK documentation).
N.B. that the Infobase is also available online at the QuArK website.

If you don't know what something does, point at it with the mouse and
look at the bottom left corner of the editor.  If some help is
available on that item, a message saying "Press F1 for help" should
appear.  Well, you guessed it, you press F1 for help.  If any further
info is available, an Infobase button will be in the bottom corner of
the help snippet, and will take you to the relevant Infobase page.

If you're still stuck, people will be happy to help you on the QuArK
mailing lists (see http://www.planetquake.com/quark/forums.shtml).
