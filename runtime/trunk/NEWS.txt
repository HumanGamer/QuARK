        #####    Quake Army Knife 6.4 Changelog


6.4.0 alpha 4
=============
 * [Decker-cdunde]: New HotKey (Alt-D) and Selection menu function,            Make Detail for setting multiple poly and face texture flag
      to detail and related Infobase update.

 * [SilverPaladin]: Improved the compiling menu for The-WildWest 
      Maps.  Q3Map2 2.5.11 or newer is recommended.  Updated the 
      Wild-West support for the version 1.5 release.

 * [SilverPaladin] Fixed the model handling so that if a skin is not 
      found uncompressed on your hard drive, it will look in the pack 
      files you've loaded for the game.  
 
 * [SilverPaladin] Fixed the last two compilation warnings in the 
      Quark source code. Quark now compiles warning and hit free in 
      Delphi 5 and 6.  I'll check under Delphi 7 soon.
       
 * [SilverPaladin] Fixed several access violations that could occur 
      when closing QuArK.
 
 * [SilverPaladin] Protected against several divide by zero errors 
      that would occur when viewing MD3 files in Quark.  

 * [SilverPaladin] Changed the general saving method so that 
      "Unsupported File Format" errors still allow you to save your
      QRK file and not lose your work.  This could occur if you linked 
      to an MD3 file in an add-on.

 * [SilverPaladin] Updated the Map Check methods so that you can have 
      brush objects contain only beziers.  Prior to this an error 
      message was displayed erroneously stating your map would not 
      work if a brush entity did not contain at least on poly.  This 
      message has been eliminated in all games which support Bezier 
      Patches.


6.4.0 alpha 3
=============

 * [peter-b]: Removed reliance on external string library (QuArK now
      uses Python's built-in string library directly).

 * [peter-b]: Python 1.5 no longer supported: QuArK now only works
      with Python 2.0 or higher.

 * [cdunde]: Added 'Grid scale in 2D views' feature to Options menu.
      By activating the sub-menu items they will place the current
      grid setting numbers on that particular view and will increase
      or decrease as you zoom in and out.

 * [peter-b]: Reorganised documentation to conform more closely to the
      norm for GPL projects.


6.4.0 alpha 2
=============

 * [cdunde]: Added 'Look and Zoom in 3D views' feature to Options menu
      and which is activated by the 'Zoom to selection' button in the
      'Selection Toolbar' with related hint and Infobase entry.

 * [SilverPaladin]: Fixed the error that caused all Toolbox window
      Edit and Toolboxes menus not to work.


6.4.0 alpha 1
=============

 * [SilverPaladin]: Eliminated Delphi 1-3 support by converting all
      forms to text forms for better CVS management and by adding 32
      bit properties to the projects.

 * [SilverPaladin]: Fixed the error that caused all 3d Windows to fail
      when one is closed.

 * [SilverPaladin]: Added support for Return to Castle Wolfenstein:
      The WildWest (1.4).	

 * [nerdiii]: Edited default.qrk so texture origin and size are
      displayed with two decimals

 * [dannsdinosaurs]:  Heretic II Add-on Data, Added DEATHMATCH
      spawnflag to all weapons & ammo. Added NOT DEATHMATCH to doors,
      levers, buttons, puzzle pieces.

 * [SilverPaladin]: Changed model handling so that QIII/RtCW/WW models
      can be loaded.

 * [peter-b]: Revision of the way Python version & DLL path are logged

 * [peter-b]: Bundled Python upgrade to 2.2.3

 * [peter-b]: New executable installer and release policy

 * [SilverPaladin]: General Clean Up
      - Eliminated all Delphi 5 Hints and Warnings
      - Eliminated all Delphi 6 Hints and all but 2 Delphi 6 Warnings
      - Fixed Index out of bounds error producing false positives
        during leak search...
      - Improved platform independance for future porting to linux
      - Modified Normalise so that zero length vectors are returned
        unmodified 
      - Cleaned up Direct3d hints and warninds
      - Eliminated an access violation in the 3d views

 * [peter-b, marco leise]: Fix for lambda bug

 * [cdunde]: Creation of new Selection toolbar and expansion of the
      Tagside toolbar. Both with new icons, active function hints and
      Infobase links.

 * [cdunde, Decker and others]: Addons menu creation for adding 3rd
      party programs to various sub-menus categories. To run and
      import their map output shapes. Also import any out side map to
      editor.

 * [peter-b]: Build Infobase on case-sensitive operating systems
      (such as Linux)

 * [peter-b]: Python bundling

 * [cdunde, tiglari]: mapstairs problems; fixed bug and added 'old
      style' flag.

 * [dannj] Heretic2 data: Fixed material types for trains, added
      ANIMATE flag for floor torch, fixed current direction
      descriptions, added angle specifics for lots of entities and
      more.

6.4  alpha snapshot Mar 29 2003
===============================

 There are quite a lot of new features here, one of the most
 noteworthy is that many of the help popup windows have a button in
 them which will call up the relevant infobase page.  This feature was
 conceived and implemented by cdunde, with some help from Andy Vincent
 and tiglari.  To use the new feature, you need to unzip the infobase
 (downloadable help file) into a subfolder of your QuArK folder called
 `help'.  For best results, use the most recent one, linked to from
 whereever you downloaded this from.

 Other additions include display of transparency in Q2 and other
 games, loading portal files, and a brush-from number-finder.  Here's
 the list, complete except for whatever I've forgotten:

      PYTHON22_OR_BETTER to the Project Conditional Defines.
    
QuArK 6.3
=========

 * [tiglari] bugs with bsp-viewing fixed

 * [tiglari] add 'nolinear' form and checkmark to path duplicator;
      this means that linear mappings will work on it properly

 * [tiglari] revise wallmaker form to encourage extruded version,
      deprecate negative polys, and suggest using sold for revision of
      complex forms.

 * [tiglari] fix error-on-RMB-on-vertex-in-restricted-selection bug
                        
 * [tiglari] mirror-image  face|textures RMB command.
       
 * [tiglari] finding and fixing faces with non-integral vertices -
      finder on search, fixer on command menus; F1 for help.

 * [decker] calculation of jumppad trajectories for Q3 
 
 * [tiglari] add .pts loading commands to defaults for Q1, Hx2, HL

 * [tiglari] lighting problems with etp and V220 formats, pinned down
      with great effort by quantum_red, fixed.

 * [tiglari] bug with non-inverse brush arches fixed (found by
      quantum_red)

 * [tiglari] problems with valve mapversion220 format writing fixed
      (ditto)

 * [cdunde] Meaningful movepal icons
 
 * [tiglari] fix RTCW misc_model models, many skins still AWOL dunno
      why

 * [ut_fourdays] bad spawnflag fix for func_door/rotating

 * [quantum_red,Decker,tiglari] fix dual screen monitor problem

 * [Decker] Fixed GDI-object(s) not being released (leaked), when
      using colors on tree-view groups (reported by Raybot).

 * [decker]  bugfixes to -mapbrushcurves.py, mapquakemenu.py,
      maptexsearch.py, mapdupspath (involving 'level' flag).

 * [tiglari] Fix problems with texture positioning in Classic Quake
      and Quark etp mode (reported on the rust QuArK forum, argggh
      what was I smoking when I wrote that code ...)
                 
 * [tiglari] Improve many of the search dialogs (thin faces,
      microbrushes, bad texture scales, targetting/ed, bsp study,
      browse multiple selection) so that they start with the first
      item on the list loaded and ready to go, and don't chose the
      first of two items with identical names.

 * [tiglari] Radiant-style dragging for frozen selections (if
      drag starts inside brush/patch but not on a handle, the whole
      thing is drug, if drag starts outside of brush, most nearly
      facing face is.  Dragging of handles stays as before.

 * [Decker] Map-editor's "Search and replace texture" now also works
      as a search-for-texture in the map. Not to be confused with the
      "Search for texture" which only searches in the texture-browser.

 * [tiglari] Replace texture dialog: if just a face is selected, its
      texture is now loaded into dialog (bug report from fpbrowser)

 * [tiglari] some Valve 220 map reading errors now recorded in the
      console (bad texture scale info)

 * [tiglari] Bezier patches selectable from back as well as front
  
 * [tiglari] Bilinear filtering option for textures in OpenGL view
      (supported by a lot of code cleanup by Decker and Andy)
      
 * [tiglari] Configurable 'Aux Keys' held down to select brushes,
      faces, curves and entities
      
 * [tiglari] 'frozen selection': Shift-LMB like Radiant select,
   selection doesn't change until another frozen selection is made,
   selection is changed in tree-view, or deselected with ESC or
   Unfreeze selection
                 
 * [tiglari] Mohaa map reading implemented, various map writing bugs
      fixed

 * [nurail] JKII light path entities corrected
   
 * [nurail] error involving line 447 mapquakemenu hopefully fixed

 * [rtdtheprof] torque maps read correctly

 * [tiglari] Mohaa maps should now be written correctly (not read,
      yet). 
                
 * [tiglari] mirror duplicators are supposed to work now.  This is
       really a fix to new texture positioning scheme, the underlying
       problem might have been having other repercussions.
                
 * [tiglari] fix errors on opening map editor (for some people, not
      me, for reasons which I don't understand at all)

 * [tiglari] basic Mohaa maps now compile and run.  Texture flags
   don't work yet but.  Another peculiar feature of Mohaa is that the
   maps are written into the main directory, since the engine seems to
   have trouble with tmpquark.  This may change.

QuArK Snapshot of 2002ap29
==========================
                
 * [Decker, tiglari] improved RTCW support
 
 * [tiglari] fix bug in brush primitives writing
 
 * [Decker] start Mohaa support
 
 * [Andy] start JKII support
 
 * [Rowdy] make it compile in Delphi 6

 * [tiglari] On search menu, 'find bad tex scale' item that locates
      faces with axes almost parallel or too small (the settable
      parameters; I'm open to suggestion as to what the default values
      should actually be).

 * [tiglari] `Move containing' item on the vertex RMB that moves the
      parent item selected from the submenu so that the vertex becomes
      on-grid

 * [tiglari] Better F1 help for the 'texture wrap multiplier' menu
      item on the face RMB|Textures submenu
     
 * [tiglari] fix groups hidden/greyed icon change (report by
      off_by_two)

 * [tiglari] change map-writing system so that format is specified in
      game config rather than Map|Option flags.

This snapshot is distributed also as a patch that can be overwritten
on the 2002feb28 snapshot.
  
QuArK Snapshot of 2002feb28
===========================
           
 * [Andy] .md3 skins can hopefully be loaded from paths with forward
      slashes

 * [Decker/tiglari] a memory leak involving the display of textures in
      the multi-pages panel has hopefully been fixed
    
 * [tiglari] memory-use tracker.  To use it, first check Developer
      mode in the options menu, then restart QuArk.  On the command
      menu will appear an item 'heapstatus', click it to get a display
      of how much memory has been allocated, and on a second click,
      how much this has changed.  The undo stack seems to consume
      about 1500 bytes for a simple brush move; I set this to 0 for
      leak hunting.

QuArK Snapshot of 2002feb24
===========================

 * [Decker] Added some Medal of Honor:Allied Assault support. Not
      much, as the buildtools for maps (.BSP files and such) have not
      yet been released, nor have entity-describtions.

 * [Decker] The buildtools-setup for Return to Castle Wolfenstein is
      now configured for GTKRadiant's Q3MAP.EXE program.

 * [Andy/Decker] Added .PNG images file support, though only
      8-bits/paletted images shown in QuArK's texture-browser. This
      means that any 24-bits .PNG images will not show correctly in
      QuArK. (Programmers note: Duplicated ZLib code. Should try to
      only use source\components\zip, and eliminate the need for
      source\components\PNGZlib.PAS and source\components\*.OBJ)

 * [Andy/Decker] Added Tribes 2 .VL2 and .CS-script files
      support. Note that .VL2 files are actually .ZIP files, just like
      .PK3 files are, so if you're not happy with the way QuArK
      handles .VL2 files, you can use WinZIP or any other
      ZIP-utility. And .CS files are just plain text-files, so use
      your favorite "NotePad"-editor.

QuArK Snapshot of 2002jan06
===========================

 * [Decker] Added Return to Castle Wolfenstein game-support, though
      the buildtools-setup for RTCW isn't configured properly yet.


 * [Decker] Maybe fixed the problem, of endlessly occuring dialog-
      boxes, which asked if QuArK should save modified files
      now. Usually this happened, when using the "Create new
      texture-links" in the Texture Browser, and just continued to
      work within QuArK. (See revision 1.29 of Qk1.PAS)

Patch2 to O80601 Snapshot
=========================

 * 'hlradfilemaker' duplicator plugin.

 * 'symxyz' duplicator with toggleable axes.

 * 'Adjust Angles Automatically' Menu Option and 'Auto-Adjust Normal'
   Map option renamed to `Quantize angles'

 * usercenters now transform with containing groups under linear
   mapping

 * Q3A CDROM config now works.

 * fix bugs in snap object (separation, when selected or tagged face
   is horizontal)

 * refurbish slide poly etc plugin; now works wrt tagged plane as well
   as tagged edge

 * Some Half-Life config fixes (see DataHL.qrk changelog)


Patch1 to 080601 Snaphsot
=========================

 * reset texture cycle command, so that the texture cycle files can be
   edited, and results seen in the same editing session

 * 'snap object to tagged' menu item: if a face is tagged, select a
   face, then a parental object from the menu, then 'snap object to
   tagged'.  Object will move and rotate that selected face is
   oriented parallel to tagged one, with specified separation.

QuArK Snapshot of 080601
========================

Changes from 070901:

 *Multiple selection list browser:
    when there is a multiple selection, menu-items and a hotkey
    are activated to list the selected items in a dialog, from
    which the members can be further selected.

 *Texture substitution cycle for standard duplicators
   (basic, linear): give the specific tex_sub the name
   of a file such as texcycle.txt.  The file should
   have a list of texture names on each line, whitespace-
   separated, e.g.:

    gothic_block/block10d gothic_block/blocks10

 *clear mark command.

 *threepoint plane can now glue to tagged plane

 *BSP Support:
    - all bsp's viewed except for Sin (patches omitted from Q3A/STVEF)

    - entity lumps now edit correctly (comments no longer mis-written
         into them)

    - bsp exploration facilities:

        due to less memory use & chance of accidental
        save.

        Command menu items for collecting nodes & planes;
        these appear in the treeview.  Large maps can't show
        all the planes in the treeview.

        When asked whether to save changes, don't.

        There are also some facilities for finding planes
        that lie near others: first you get ones that have
        close neighbors, then you can collect those neighbors,
        then browse the group (including opening the nodes to
        find the nodes split by a given plane).

 *Blue Shift pak's now open

 *Crystal Space Support:
    beziers & new build tool for Crystal Space support


 *6DX support:

     -Start room removed for 6DX

     - *.hmf file support added for 6dx, map checks disabled.
         6dx default map needs textures added to it
         (in data6dx.qrk)


             QuArK Snapshot 070901

Changes from 081801

 *Preliminary 6DX support
 *Cleanup of Crystal Space Support
 *arg replacer added to duplicator list (see infobase
    for usage)
 *some extruder bugs fixed
 *path dup texture bug fixed
 *'elbows' for path dup reinstated and tested
    (made elbow segs by putting path dup template
     copy into elbow template & glueing and pasting
     do dissociated path dup; didn't leak)
 *texture browser search bug fixed

             QuArK Snapshot 061801

Changes from 052101

 4 Users:
  *texture search button in texture browser
  *storeable 3d camera positions
    - add them on the 3d view eye handles & background
        RMB menus
    - they appear in the map and treeview like
        duplicators, can be dragged, deleted, etc
        like ordinary map objects
    - set and store view menu items on their RMB
    - if multiple views are open, these commands use
       the last 3d view clicked on (usually, doesn't
       quite always seem to work, dunno why)
    - cycle the ones in a group with prev/next +
        'C' depressed (should be made user-configurable)
    - find camera positions dialog on search menu
  *extruder 'revert to duplicator' now imports
    texture changes back to duplicator, so you can
    texture at least the first segment of the extruder
    by dissociating images, then change shape by revert
    to duplicator.  Hopefully useful when 1-segment
    extruder is put into path duplicator.
  *group selection movement commands (swap & align,
   suggested by Alan Donald and quantum_red)
  *due north path duplicator bug fixed
  *menu promotion/demotion added to the basic distribution
  *incrementable specifics added to basic, linear, symx/y/z
    and Copy/New Copy One duplicators.
     - If 'increment' specific is checked, then target,
         targetname and killtarget specifics ending in
         a string of digits have the digid string incremented
         in the sequence.
     - if 'incr. all targ. specific is checked, all specifics
         whose name contains 'target' get incremented.
     - any specifics listed in 'incrementable; are also
         incremented.
     - if 'final_target' has a value, this is used as the
         'target' value in the last image.  Likewise
         for 'final_killtarget' etc.
     - if 'increment by' has a value, then this is used
         as the increment, rather than 1.  This can be
         used to use increments with nested duplicators,
         if the outer one increments by 10 and the inner
         by 1, you can have an Nx9 grid,etc.
     - if 'incre_lip' has a value, then that value is
         used to increment the 'lip' speciric, likewise
         incre_<spec> for any other choice of <spec>.
     - for (New) Copy One, each duplictor needs a different
         'increment by' value (otherwise crosstalk).

     Limitation: Doesn't work for symxy and
       Radial duplicators (yet; if you want it to,
       holler).
  *corrections to the 'vertex movement' plugin (this is
    still basically experimental)
  *new 3 point plane stuff:
    a) introduce one from New Map Items|tools, drag
         the handles around and tag it, the glue, cut
         etc.
    b) use tag plane command after tagging an edge

 Under the hood:
   *entity conversion (fgd->qrk) tools pythonified
   *'Code Code' specific for toolbarbuttons (tbbtn) and
     the python buttons (Typ="P" only).

    Example for tbbtn:

     search1:tbbtn = {
       Typ = "P"
       Cap = "Search"
       Code = "import plugins.tex_search; plugins.tex_search.openbox()"
     }

     GetEntitiesBtn: =
     {
       Typ = "P"
       Cap = "Get entities for this game"
       Code = "import quarkx; quarkx.beep()"
     }

   will execute the python string in the Code specifics.


               63 Snapshot 052101

 Changes from 050701:

  *Bsp opening bug in 050701 fixed
  *Map writing altered for brush primitives, Valve mapversion
    220, and 'No TX comments' mode so that if integral or
    almost integral vertexes for a face are found, they are
    used as its threepoints.  This enables better export
    of maps to editors and tools that don't support fp
    coordinates.
  *'thin face' finder added (similar to microbrush h/k);
     detect & remove suspiciously thin faces.
  *when an 'out' duplicator is dissociated, all
    other 'out' dups in its immediate group are
    dissociated also
  *caulk of hidden faces added to brush curves & extruder
    (default tex used for games w/o a caulk texture)
  *wrong shape for non-inner non-inverse cap/bevels
    fixed (missing faces added)
  *'linear' (matrix) specific editor.
    try out with New Copy One duplicator, push button
    to call up editing dialog.
  *matrix2 support changed to linear in radial dup.
  *rotate/scale specifics removed from linearform
  *linear duplicators changed to so that by default,
    mappings apply around 'usercenter' of each item
    in their group, rather than duplicator location

     -- group
          |
          ---- linear duplicator
          |
          ----- group: if this group has a usercenter,
          |        and the dup has a linear specific,
          |        the mapping will apply with the
          |        usercenter as fixed point
          |
          ------group: ditto for this one (each around
                  its own center, seems wierd but
                  features of the code make it tricky
                  to do otherwise).

    old behavior can be restored by unchecking 'item center'.
  *support for the commercial counterstrike/hl
     expansion.
  *Hollowmaker/Wallmaker bug fixed
  *debug writing 'left' to console bug fixed


 Changes from  Snapshot 042801

  *Dragging on RMB blocked.  If anyone wants it back, an option
    could be provided.
  *instance duplicator removed from toolbox, pushing
    'instance' drops it into path dup, where it
    dumps things at the path points.  linear stuff
    removed from path point forms, prolly not useful
    New Copy One does that stuff better.
  *extruder functionality extended.  RMB menu has
    items for punching holes in things (e.g. putting
    a pipe thru a wall w/o overlap).  After 'dissociate
    images', RMB on the resulting group has an 'Extruder
    Stuff' submenu with the hole-punching, some texturing
    stuff that doesn't work right, and a 'revert' that
    restores the duplicator.
  *New Copy One duplicator, implementing ideas of Rolf
     Hulsbergen (better than Instance Dup, for many
     purposes): drop NCO into group like ordinary
     duplicator , drag image away with handle, use scale\
     & rotation fields to rotate around dup location.
  *rotation specific for linear & other dups changed
     to Typ E, so that rotation handles will work.
  *wrap texture from tagged works for parallel faces
  *wrap texture hotkey works.
  *forms creation added to forms editor
  *stvef maps now readable (no more reversion to Q3A mode,
    if in STVEF mode)


 Changes from Snapshot 042001:

  *RMB Menus for the Texture L handles: (tiglari)
    glue/align to tagged.

  *Reimplementation of addon builder: (Andy) still crashes on
    missionpack, this can be avoided by extracting the .bsp's &
    temporarily giving the .pk3 a different extension.

  *Selection menu: (tiglari, major Decker design input)
    change selection to Parent, Next, Previous in group.
      (no 'type' selections yet)

  *Reorganize/Navigate tree added to bezier RMB

  *having 'F' depressed with LMB will now select a face of current
     poly, rather than next poly.


 Changes from 6.2:

  *Customizable hot keys: (tiglari)
    Perhaps more hot  keys should be added.  Which ones?

  *Custom Centers for groups: (tiglari)
    various linear matrix operations (rotations etc)
    will use these if present

  *'scale' and 'rotation' specifics: (tiglari)
    for Linear & some other duplicators.  Does the
    work of 'linear' but more perspicuously.

  *Extuder: (tiglari)
    Makes solid & hollow pipes from 2d outline.  Put
    into path duplicator to extrude along path.

  *Instance Duplicator: (tiglari)
    For lots of copies in various places, idependent
    scale & rotation.

  *Entity Extractor: (Andy)
    I see some problem, not sure if I'm using it right.

  *Merge Polys in Group: (tiglari)
    Mergeable polys in a group are merged.  Not guaranteed
    optimal.
