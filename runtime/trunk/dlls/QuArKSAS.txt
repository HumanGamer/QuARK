QuArK SAS (Steam Access System)
-------------------------------
Version 1.0
14 August 2007



Program description
-------------------
QuArK SAS is a small command-line utility that allows you to extract files from Steam. For this to work, Steam must be running, and you probably have to be logged in. It produces a log-file which easily allows diagnoses when the program for some reason doesn't work. It's designed to be as light-weighted as possible (that's why there is no GUI), and run on as many systems as possible.
The executable file has to be placed in the %Steam%/steamapps/%username%/sourcesdk/bin folder to work, although it might also function from other bin folders in the Steam directory.



Program usage
-------------
This is a direct copy from the program:

QuArKSAS.exe [parameters] <filenames>
<filenames>: All the filenames of the files to extract.

Available parameters:
-g <ID>: Set Steam game number (default: 220 (HL2)).
-gamedir <directory>: The game directory containing the to extract files.
-help: Displays this information.
-o <directory>: Specifies the output directory.
-overwrite: Overwrite any existing output files.
-v <number>: Verbose log level. 0 is least output, 40 is max.
/?: Displays this information.


After all parameters have been read from left to right,
the rest will be interpreted as <filenames>.

Note: all parameters are case-sensitive.



Notes
-----
This program is used by the map/model editor QuArK (hence the name). However, it's free and open-source, so anybody can use this as they please (also see 'License' below). If you don't like the QuArK part of the name, simply call it QSAS :)
