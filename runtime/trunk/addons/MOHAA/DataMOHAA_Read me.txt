notes on the Mohaa file

 The weapon entity data in the included qrk file is was just "mocked" to fit in with the rest of the other entites in the qrk file.
the weapon entity names were taken from MOHradiant

other notes
i have recieved information that for the weapon entities to work,for every map you create, you have to make a script file with the same name
as your map. the ligitimacy of this info is unkown.
