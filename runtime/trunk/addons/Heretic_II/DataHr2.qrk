// Configuration file for Heretic II


// 2DO list: models, subsorting of obj's.

//  Entities revised by tiglari, Nov 29, 1998.

//  Further revisions by tiglari, Nov 30, 1998 (descriptions
//    cleaned up, html help added, the files for which should go
//    into the folder help/hr2).

//  Dec 2, 1998 More Revisions, tiglari

//  Dec 4, Major reworking of spawnflags, tiglari

//  Dec 12, script runner added, text_msg included, other tidying.
//    There's still plenty to do!

//  Dec 13, added full texture list, but they need more sorting.
//    I think the right way to do it would be by type, (floor, wall,
//    etc.) within each theme category (Andoria, Canyon, etc.)
//    But there's no reason why there can't be lots of add-ons with
//    different sorting of the textures.
//  Dec 13b, fixed some stuff I screwed up on the Dec12 update ...

//  Jan 8, added origin brushes to entities that want them, other minor
//   updates.

//  March 18, assorted omitted keys added (egged on by Wankeroo)

//  April 6, material type surface flags
