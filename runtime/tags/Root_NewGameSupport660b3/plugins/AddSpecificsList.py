    #            - Common specifics are items used by most entities except 'worldspawn' and 'info_' entities.
    #            - Here you have two choices, by setting their values to 1, they are:
    #            - To "WriteCommonSpecifics" which just writes them to the file to set them up.
    #            - To "UseCommonSpecifics" which writes their "include" code to each entity that might use them.
    #            - If the second is set to 1 and the first is not,
    #            -     it will not write the "include" code because it doesn't exist.
    #            - Right now they only include "target" and "targetname". You can change or add to the "commonspecifics",
    #            -     but remember to also change or add to the "commonspecificslist" to avoid duplication of these
    #            -     specifics that may already exist in the original file(s) that are being copied.

    #            -     proper location, which is usually the same place where the "Pak" files are located.
    #            - Some games use a "script" file instead of the actual model file. If this is the case then
    #            -    the type of script file, ex: cik, can be used as the setting for the "ModelFileType".
