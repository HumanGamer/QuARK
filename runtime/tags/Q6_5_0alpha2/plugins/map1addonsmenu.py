It demonstrates how a Main menu category can be added with a plugin file. The file name is map1addonsmenu.py and it also demonstrates how even a Main menu button can have an F1 help popup window and link to the infobase pages. The only difference is that one of the buttons of the Main menu has to be activated (clicked on) to initiate this feature. One other feature of this menu category, is the sub-menu drop down buttons. All these functions can be studied by reviewing the map1addonsmenu file in the plugins folder, and the mapmenus.py file located in the quarkpy folder (to see how the 'Addons' Main menu category is done).", infobaselink="intro.mapeditor.menu.html#addonsmenu"), AddonsMenuShortcuts
