QuArK SAS (Steam Access System)
-------------------------------
Version 1.04?
?? ??? ????



Program description
-------------------
QuArK SAS is a small command-line utility that allows you to extract files from Steam. For this to work, Steam must be running, and you should be logged in. It produces a log-file which allows for easy diagnosing when the program for some reason doesn't work properly. It's designed to be as light-weighted as possible (that's why there is no GUI), and to run on as many systems as possible.

The executable file has to be placed in the right folder to work:

engine     | directory                                                 | executable filename     | remarks
-----------|-----------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------|--------- - - -
old        | %Steam%/steamapps/%username%/sourcesdk/bin                | QuArKSAS.exe            | Not used anymore
source2006 | %Steam%/steamapps/%username%/sourcesdk/bin/ep1/bin        | QuArKSAS.exe            | Previously known as: ep1
source2007 | %Steam%/steamapps/%username%/sourcesdk/bin/source2007/bin | QuArKSAS_source2007.exe | Previously known as: orangebox
source2009 | %Steam%/steamapps/%username%/sourcesdk/bin/orangebox/bin  | QuArKSAS_orangebox.exe  |

When not placed in the correct directory, QuArK SAS will not be able to find several Steam files (like tier0.dll) and will crash on startup. Also, make sure you've run the Source SDK at least once before (or manually refresh its contents), so the Steam files are set-up properly.

If you're attempting to up- or down-grade the QuArK SAS that comes with QuArK, put it in QuArK's "dlls" directory instead. QuArK will then automatically deploy it to the Source SDK directory.



Program usage
-------------
This is a direct copy from the program's own output:

QuArKSAS.exe [parameters] <filenames>
<filenames>: All the filenames of the files to extract.

Available parameters:
-g <ID>: Set Steam game number (default: 220 (HL2)).
-gamedir <directory>: The game directory containing the data-files from which to extract.
-help: Displays this information.
-o <directory>: Specifies the output directory.
-overwrite: Overwrite any existing output files.
-v <number>: Verbose log level. 0 is least output, 40 is max.
/?: Displays this information.


After all parameters have been read from left to right,
the rest will be interpreted as <filenames>.

Note: all parameters are case-sensitive.



Source code
-----------
The source code of this program is freely available (also see 'License' below), and can be downloaded from the SourceForge site (http://sourceforge.net/projects/quark/files/QuArKSAS/).

In order to compile the source code, create a mod for the right engine through the Source SDK. Extract the source code into a folder in the 'utils' directory inside the mod directory. For example: *mod_dir*\utils\QuArKSAS.

The source code should compile perfectly fine with any modern C++ compiler, under Win32. I've used Visual C++ Express 2010, freely available for download from Microsoft. Even though Steam now also runs on Mac OS, I've (currently) got no plans for porting, although I doubt it would be that difficult.

Notes
-----
This program is primarily made for usage by the map/model editor Quake Army Knife (QuArK), and hence the name. However, it's free and open-source, so anybody can use this as they please (also see 'License' below). If you don't like the QuArK part of the name, simply call it QSAS :)
