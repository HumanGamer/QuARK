<name>Three point cut-plane</name>
<dl>
	<dt><b>Problem:</b>
	<dd>Cutting using the current cut-tool, only splits/cuts the polys in the current compass-selected view,
	    looking into the screen. A way of cutting polys with a plane/face thats been defined by three points in
			space, would be helpfull in those cases where a complex split/cut have to be made.
		<br><br>
	<dt><b>Suggestion for plug-in:</b>
	<dd>Three point plane clipping works this way: You place three points in the 2D and/or 3D views,
	    which together define a plane/face. The selected polys are then split/cut along that plane/face.
