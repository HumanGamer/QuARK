	<dd>Not a problem, more an idea, of a new object that can be used in map-building, especially for cave and terrain areas.

The way the 'polygon' (2D-shape) would work is you create an arbitrary convex
polygon (perhaps you create it from selected point entities or perhaps
from a brush face or perhaps you create a 'polygon' first then add
vertices to it.) Then at compile time the convex polygon becomes a solid brush by being "extruded."<br>
<!--This is a very simple process which could be implemented
several ways. My favorite is to find the nearest major axis (x, y or z)
to the normal of the polygon and duplicate the polygon's vertices along
that axis.
(you could duplicate the polygon's vertices along it's own normal but
then it wouldn't fit neatly with surounding brushes or 'polygons')
Then you can find the planes that make up the brush by picking three
vertices from the original polygon, then three vertices from the
duplicate, then two vertices from one and one vertex from the other for
each of the other faces.-->
This plug-in would eliminate clutter in much the same way that negative
polyhedrons do, but without some of the risks associated with csg
operations, and it would be especially convenient for modeling complex
geometry like caves and terrain.<br>
<span class="sml">(A simpler but almost just as good alternative to 'polygon' would be
'triangle' which would be less versatile but gauranteed to be a flat
convex polygon no matter how you try to move the vertices.)</span>
