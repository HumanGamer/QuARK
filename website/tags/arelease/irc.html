<b>QuArK real-time chat.</b><br>
<br>
On <a href="irc://irc.gamesnet.net/quark">irc.gamesnet.net</a> a channel named #quark has been created. <span class="xsml">(Thanks to rd.)</span><br>
And on <a href="irc://irc.enterthegame.com/quark">irc.enterthegame.com</a> a channel named #QuArK has been created. <span class="xsml">(Thanks to Skarecrowe.)</span><br>
Even on <a href="irc://irc.quakenet.org/quark">irc.quakenet.org</a> a channel named #QuArK is created. <span class="xsml">(Thanks to Neuro.)</span><br>
<br>
However, don't expect that the QuArK-team always is on those IRC-channels.
Some of us have Real-Life<sup>(tm)&nbsp;</sup> to attend to. Also, some
pay-per-minute they're online, so 24/7-online time is not feasible.
