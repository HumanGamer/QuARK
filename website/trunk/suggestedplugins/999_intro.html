The contents on this page have been gathered from the <a href="forums.shtml">forums</a>,
when people from the QuArK community wrote, that such and such a plug-in could be really
handy if it were made.  Also look at the 'plans' section of the QuArK infobase.<br>
<br>
Most of the people that get the ideas for those plug-ins, don't know how to code them themself,
so to help them - and that is what the QuArK community is all about - this page will list the suggested
plug-ins, if other people are interested and if they are under development or not.<br>
<br>
If <u>you</u> want to help develop one or more of the suggested plug-ins, please mail the
<a href="javascript:mail_decode('qrpxre@cynargdhnxr.pbz?obql=-- ABGVPR: UGZY r-znvyf jvyy or obhaprq, fb fraq bayl va cynva-grkg! /Qrpxre --');">webmaster</a>, notifying him about your participation.
If you have an idea for a plug-in, which would be possible to implement and usefull during map-building,
you can either write about it in the <a href="forums.shtml">forums</a> or mail the <a href="javascript:mail_decode('qrpxre@cynargdhnxr.pbz?obql=-- ABGVPR: UGZY r-znvyf jvyy or obhaprq, fb fraq bayl va cynva-grkg! /Qrpxre --');">webmaster</a> using the
<i>problem / suggestion</i> structure as shown below in the already suggested plug-ins.<br>
