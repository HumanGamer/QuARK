	<dt><b>Problem:</b>
  <dd>
Arches can be annoying to create taking up time, architecture
in general is. But there are common elements to make up a level and I
think arches is an essential part.

	<dt><b>Suggestion for plug-in:</b>
	<dd>
Some sort of plugin (if this is possible) to create an arch
where you can determine its width height, how hollow it is, etc. I know
this sounds lazy :P but you wouldn't believe the amount of time I've spend
making sure vertexes are aligned to not get errors :)

      Implemented in QuArK 6.1c<br><br>
      Create a cube, right-mouse-click on the cube's movement handle, and then in the context-menu choose
      'Brush Curves -&gt; Arch'.
