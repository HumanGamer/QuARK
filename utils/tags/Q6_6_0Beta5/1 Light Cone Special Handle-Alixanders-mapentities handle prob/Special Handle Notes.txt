quarkpy\maphandles.py line 458 draws the extended handle, but Alex
used the parent class of (FaceHandle) in line 414 when he should have
used the parent class of (PointSpecHandle). That is why his
class SpecialHandle on line 458 drew his special handle for
a face selection instead of the light_spot entitiy he wanted.

Now I think it should be quarkpy\maphandles.py
(Angles3DHandle) line 312

AttributeError: SpecialHandle instance has no attribute 'face'

I changed that parent class and stopped the special handle from
drawing on a face selection, but we need to have it draw for the
light_spot entitiy and it is not doing that right now. So need to
varify that is the correct parent class and\or its arguments to
get the special handle to draw.

Most of it is working right now. Plus only the light_spot entitiy
on the board is setup correctly, the one in the "New Items" is not,
it just needs default values set for the 1st "_light" Specific and
that should be 255 255 255 500 like the one on the icon board.

The light_environment is setup correctly for both.

Got Circles to draw and this erron now:
