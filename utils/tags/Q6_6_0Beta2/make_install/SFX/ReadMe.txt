1. ****************************************** compilation notes :

IMPORTANT NOTES YOU MUST READ!!!

To compile this project under Delphi2/3/4 correctly, you should do
the following :

- compiling the sfx source without having the original SFX.DOF
  increases the size of the executable.  I am now including the
  original SFX.DOF file.  Do NOT modify the .DOF file unless
  you don't mind a larger executable!

- if the project-options are displayed (not even changed!)
  within the Delphi IDE, the size will increase, too.

- to get the sfx running properly, you should first compile it to
  determine the size of your .EXE file.  After that, edit the file:
  "dialog.pas", and make sure "StartOfFile" is set to the size
  of YOUR new SFX.EXE file.

  To find the location in DIALOG.PAS to put the size of the
  SFX.EXE size, find procedure "getdefaultparams". Then look for
  this line:
     startoffile := xxxxx; (a decimal number ~ 40448 [D4] )

  Change this line to show the new size of your SFX.EXE file.
  Then, compile the project again.

- after recompiling the SFX project, do NOT let Delphi save the
  changes!  If you let it save the changes, it'll screw up the .DOF
  file, and your next executable will be larger!  If you want to
  modify the code and save it, make sure you restore the original
  .DOF file later so you can have a smaller .EXE!

- after recompiling the SFX project, rename SFX.EXE to ZIPSFX.BIN,
  and copy it over the top of your last version of ZIPSFX.BIN
  (normally in the WINDOWS SYSTEM folder).


2. ********************************* the structure of a zipsfx-file :
- zipsfx-executable code (0-xxxxx)
- signature "MPV"                        or                           zip-archive
-                |_ rest of the special header
-                                             |_ zip-archive

the structure of the special-header :
Byte 0..2   : signature "MPV"

Byte    3   : Bit 0 (val  1) : if set, user can disable running the command line after extraction (if any)
              Bit 1 (val  2) : if set, user can choose what files to extract
              Bit 2 (val  4) : if set, user cannot change the overwrite-mode (confirm, overwrite, skip)
              Bit3-4(val 8,16) : default-overwrite mode
                     0 : confirm overwriting existing files
                     8 : overwrite existing files
                    16 : skip existing files
              Bit5 (val  32) : internally used, if set, then do not check file size
              Bit6 (val  64) : if set, then automatically extract all files
              Bit7 (val 128) : if set, don't show success message ("all files have been extracted")
Byte	4   : flag array for future enhancements
Byte    5   : Version of MPV-Header ( currently 01 and not used in sfx )
Byte    6+7 : SizeOf ( MPV-Header )
Byte    8   : length of user-defined caption / 0=default caption
Byte 9..m   : the dialog's caption, if byte 8 <> 0 ( without terminating zero)
Byte  m+1   : length of default extraction path / 0=current dir
     m+2..n : the default-extraction-path, if byte m+1 <> 0 (dito)

              ++++added  march 01,98 if set to "><", then use  temp-dir

              ##FR: added 10/10/98 If the first two characters are "HK" the extraction-path
              will be read from the registry. If the registry-key doesn't exist, the
              default path will be set to the temp path. Either full names
              (HKEY_CURRENT_USER\...) or abbreviations (as known from INF-files)
              for the root keys HKCU, HKLM and HKU are supported.
              examples:
              "HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Borland\Delphi\2.0\Library\SearchPath"
              "HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\ProgramFilesDir"
              "HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\Shell Folders\Personal"
              "HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Office\8.0\Excel\Microsoft Excel\AddIn Path"
              For subdirectories to be created use the pipe symbol "|", e.g.
              "HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\SystemRoot|NewDir"
              will parse to : "C:\Windows\NewDir" (or whereever your system root is).

Byte  n+1   : length of command line / 0=no command line
     n+2..o : the command line to execute after successfull extraction, if byte n+1 <> 0 (dito)
              format : the command line has a special format
              if the string "><" (greater than+less than) is somewhere in the command line,
              it will be replaced with the path where the archive has been extracted to.
              (e.g. "><readme\test.txt" after an extraction to the path "C:\Program files\unpacked" means :
              "c:\progra~1\unpacked\readme\test.txt") <- the short path will be created by zipsfx.
              if the pipe "|" is in the command-line, the part to the left will get the application to run
              and the part to the right will be it's argument;
              if the archive is extracted to e.g. "d:\unpack", then we will get the following :
              "><setup\setup.exe|><install.inf" will parse to :
              run "d:\unpack\setup\setup.exe" with parameters "d:\unpack\install.inf".
              "c:\windows\notepad.exe|><readme.txt" will parse to :
              run "c:\windows\notepad.exe" with parameters "d:\unpack\readme.txt".
              "><readme.txt" will parse to :
              open "d:\unpack\readme.txt" with its associated program, if there is any.
              "><setup.exe" will run "d:\unpack\setup.exe" without special parameters.
***10/10/98   INF-scripts are accepted as well //##FR
              "><setup.inf" will run the [DefaultInstall] section of "d:\unpack\setup.inf".
              "><setup.inf|.ntx86" will run the [DefaultInstall] section if Win95 (98?),
              but [DefaultInstall.ntx86] section if WinNT.

Byte  o+1   : length of message to display / 0=no message
     o+2..p : the message to display before opening the main dialog, if byte o+1 <> 0 (dito)
	      if byte 0 of this message is
		1 : message begins at byte o+3, messagebox style = MB_ICONINFORMATION ,
		    buttons : (ok,cancel ; if cancel is pressed, stop sfx )
		2 : message begins at byte o+3, messagebox style = MB_ICONCONFIRMATION ,
		    buttons : (yes,no ; if no is pressed, stop sfx )

the size of the special header (MPV) must be dword aligned !!! (old MPU is always 256 byte)

                      distribution policy
              guidelines for legal re-distribution

  1) this applies to both end-users and developers.
    
  2) you must not charge money for any part of the sfx package.
     warning:  the primary concern here is if you will market a
     new package that is only slightly more than a verbatim copy 
     of this package, or one of it's demos.  any release you sell
     is ok as long as you charge only for the changes you make.

  3) you must handle product support with your own end-users.
     this is imperative, because i don't have enough time to
     do support for end-users.

  4) i will handle support issues with programmers using this 
     package on a time-available basis. since this is being
     distributed as freeware, you can't expect the kind of 
     support you'd get from a commercial vendor.  please limit
     your questions to those that directly pertain to this
     sfx package.
