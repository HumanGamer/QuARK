This creates a beam effect from the origin to the target's origin. If no
target is specified, uses angles and projects beam out from there.

"model" Specifies the model to use as the beam
"overlap" Specifies the amount of overlap each beam link should have. Use this to fill
in the cracks when using electric on beams. (Default is 0)
"minoffset" Minimum amount of electrical variation (Default is 0)
"maxoffset" Maximum amount of electrical variation (Default is 5)
"color" Vector specifiying the red,green, and blue components. (Default is "1 1 1")
"alpha" Alpha of the beam (Default is 1.0)
"damage" Amount of damage the beam inflicts if beam hits someone (Default is 0)
"angles" Sets the angle of the beam if no target is specified.
"life" Sets the life of the beam for use with the persist spawnflag.  This is how long a beam will
be displayed.
"numsegments" Number of segments in a beam (Default is 4)
"delay" Delay between beam updates.  (i.e. slows the effect of the beam down)
"shader" Set the shader of the beam
"scale" Set the width of the beam

START_ON  - Starts the beam on
PERSIST   - Keeps the last few beams around and fades them out over the life of the beam
WAVE      - Make the beam follow a sin wave pattern
NOISE     - Use a more computationally expensive random effect, but the results are smoother

If the model field is not set, then a renderer generated beam will be created
using the color, minoffset, maxoffset, scale, and subdivisions fields

If the targetname is set, it will use the target specified as the endpoint of the beam

the camera will follow the path.
"speed" specifies how fast to move on the path or orbit. (default 1).
"fov" specifies fov of camera, default 90.
if fov is less than 3 than an auto-fov feature is assumed.  The fov will then
specify the ratio to be used to keep a watched entity zoomed in and on the screen

NodeType FLEE
Purpose:  Marks this spot as a safe destination for the AI when they flee

Additional Commands for FLEE type Nodes
None at this time


NodeType WORK
Purpose:  Marks this spot as a good place for the AI to work at. 
          The AI will turn to match the angles of helper node, so make sure to angle it appropriately.
          The AI will also run the animation you specify with the "setnodeanim" event and execute the
          thread you specify with the "setnodethread" event

Additional Commands for WORK type Nodes
setnodeanim        -- Sets the animation that the AI will run while on this node
setnodeentrythread -- Sets the thread that the AI will call when they arrive at this node
setnodeexitthread  -- Sets the thread that the AI will call when they leave the node
wait               -- Sets the time at this work node
waitrandom         -- Sets a random waittime from 1 to the time specified
waitforanim        -- Sets the actor to work until his animation is completed


NodeType ANIM
Purpose:  Allows you to specify a "special" animation to be played at this location.  For example, if
          you have a "dive through window" animation that you would like played as the AI moves through
          the node, you can specify it here

Additional Commands for ANIM type Nodes
setnodeanim   -- Sets the animation that the AI will run while on this node
animcount     -- Number of times the anim can be played
animtarget    -- TargetName for a specific entity you wish to be animated
animactive    -- Sets if the animation component is active
                 1 is true ( default )
                 0 is false
                 if animactive is 0, then actors will not change animations at the node

NodeType COVER
Purpose:  Marks this spot as a good place for the AI to use as cover.  The AI will turn to match the angles 
          of the helper node, so make sure to angle it appropriately.  The AI will also use the cover 
          according to the information you specify in the setcovertype and setcoverdir events.

Additional Commands for COVER type Nodes
setcovertype  -- Sets the type of cover at this spot. Valid values are ( crate , wall )                 
setcoverdir   -- Sets the direction that the AI can fire from ( Based Relative to the direction the node is facing )
                 valid values are ( left , right, all )
coveractive   -- Sets if the cover component is active
                 1 is true ( default )
                 0 is false
                 if coveractive is 0, then actors will not use it for cover.


NodeType PATROL
Purpose:  Marks a position in a patrol path.  To be of any value, though, patrol helper nodes must be chained together.
          If you want a full circuit, then you must connect all nodes together.  Any nodes CANNOT be cross linked together.
          I know, I know, it sucks, but unfortunately, due to limits with targetname, it is the way it must be.
          If you do not make a circuit, the AI will stand idle at the last node until it decides to do something else.

Additional Commands for PATROL type Nodes
wait         -- Makes the AI pause at this node for the specifed amount of time
waitrandom   -- Makes the AI pause for a random amount of time (up to a max of the amount specified )
waitforanim  -- Makes the AI pause long enough to complete his animation


NodeType SNIPER
Purpose:  Marks a position as a good sniping position.

Additional Commands for SNIPER type Nodes
wait         -- Specifies a maximum time the AI will sit at this Node
attacktarget -- Specifies a target to kill -- If not specified, will try and snipe any enemies in view
maxkills     -- Specifies the maximum number of kills at this Node


NodeType CUSTOM
Purpose: Marks the node as a custom helper node.  Must be used in conjunction with the customtype command

It is determined whether or not the player is in the right position to activate
the object, if it is, the player is moved to the exact offset and angle specified
by "offset" and "yaw_offset".  The right position is determined by a dot product
with "offset" and "yaw_offset".  The "cone" parameter controls the cone in which the
object can be triggered. Once the player is in the right position, the player is placed
into "state" and the "move" animation is played. Once the player animation ends, the
"move_thread" will be called.  If the use button is continued to be held down and count
is not finite, the animation will be continued to be played until the use key is held
down.  Once the use key is let go, the "stop" animation will be played on the lever and
the "stop_thread" will be called.

"activate" - turns the useobject on
"deactivate" - turns the useobject off
"offset" - vector offset of where the player should stand
"state" - state to go into when used
"state_backwards" - what state to use when reversing the object
"yaw_offset" - what direction the player should be facing when using the object
"cone" - the cone in which the object can be used
"count" - how many times this should trigger (default -1, infinite)
"move_thread" - thread that is fired when the object has cycled one animation
"stop_thread" - thread that is fired when the object has finished animating
"reset_thread" - thread that is fired when the object is resetting itself
"reset_time" - the time it takes for the object to reset, (default 0, it doesn't)
"triggertarget" - target to trigger when finished animating, if reset_time is set, target
will be fired again when resetting
"damage_type" - if set, can be triggered by using a weapon to activate it.  If set to "all",
any damage will activate it.

MULTI-STATE - the object has two different states and must be used each time to set the state
when multi state is active, the reset_thread is called instead of stop_thread.  All UseObjects
have two states on and off.  When reset_time is set, the object will automatically return to the
off state after a preset amount of time.  When multi-state is set this must be done manually.

Puzzle object is the basic framework for all the puzzles. It communicates 
with the script through events and threads to process the puzzle state.
All logic for the puzzle object exists in the script. 

The puzzle object contains four threads, which are ItemUsed, Solved, Canceled and Failed. 
These are explained in the Key Value Pairs section. The Puzzle object also contains an 
item used string. This allows the level designer to specify the item the player must 
use to activate the puzzle. 

Key Value Pairs:
model						 <model name>	- the tiki model to use for the puzzle object
puzzleobject_opendistance	 <distance>		- the amount of distance the player should be before the puzzle opens.
puzzleobject_itemtouse		 <item name>	- the name of the item the player must use to execute the puzzle
puzzleobject_itemusedthread	 <thread name>	- the name of the thread called when the item is used.
puzzleobject_failedthread	 <thread name>	- the name of the thread called when the puzzle fails
puzzleobject_canceledthread	 <thread name>  - the name of the thread called when the puzzle is canceled
