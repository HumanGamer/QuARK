Hey cdunde,

Apologies again for the delays, better late than never eh? :)

in mapentities.py there is:

Mapping = {
     ":d": DuplicatorType(),
     ":e": EntityType(),
     ":g": GroupType(),
     ":b": BrushEntityType(),
     ":p": PolyhedronType(),
     ":f": FaceType(),
     ":b2": BezierType() }

Pick an addon (DataQ2.qrk for example) and the light entity is configred 
as "light:e".

 From that I assume that you should be looking at class EntityType().

As far as I can tell, from the comment "3D rotating handle, for 
'angles'-like Specifics." at the start of class Angles3DHandle I would 
suspect refers to the direction handle, like to indicate the direction 
the player character is looking in.

My guess (this is a guess, I do not *know*) is:

quarkpu/mapentities.py:

class EntityType(EntityManager):
     "Quake non-brush Entities"

     def handles(o, editor, view):
         return maphandles.CenterEntityHandle(o, view)

WHen you create an instance of class EntityType(), you can call the 
handles() method of that instance to return the drag handle for that 
entity.  When you call handles() the above code executes, specifically 
the function CenterEntityHandle() in file quarkpy/maphandles.py.
